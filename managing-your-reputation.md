# Managing your reputation

#### **Day 59**

\*\*\*\*[**Is there a right way to brag?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1ynJOqoEbgXKR)\*\*\*\*

\[Ed.: As a straight white man, there are certain aspects of bragging that, when I do them, are going to read differently than for other people. I'm also in the U.S., and cultures about self-promotion differ dramatically from place to place\] 

Yes, there is a right way to brag. We often think of bragging as being a bad thing, and it can be done in an awful way.

First, unload the language: instead of calling it a "brag," for a moment think of it as "talking about good things that you are doing" or "talking about good things about yourself." Should you do that? **Check in with yourself on your reasons for talking about that part of yourself.** If it's that you're feeling insecure and you want to address the insecurity, you should stop and reassess. It takes practice to see your own reasons clearly.

There can be great reasons to brag. If you believe that by sharing some achievement of your company, it will make your employees feel proud, that could be a great reason.

\[[Minn](https://twitter.com/minney_cat): As a woman, I've experienced that it is often scarier to brag because you think that it will be read a certain way and probably received differently.\]

It takes practice. Sometimes you'll feel like you went too far. And you'll also figure out the moments when you feel confident saying, "Okay, I do want to brag about this." 

**When you figure out that you do want to brag about something, how do you do it?** 

There's a distinction between talking about things you've achieved versus talking about your own qualities. Donald Trump says, "I'm the greatest," which means nothing. It's so much more compelling to point to an achievement and say, "I'm so proud that our company reached this milestone."

You can make it even easier on yourself by being concrete. What did you contribute? What was the outcome? What ways did you help or support the people or the cause? Then articulate how you feel about the accomplishment -- why you are proud, for example. And instead of thinking about it as bragging, think about it as a way to signal to other people what you care about.

Recognize the goal of the brag, if there's a professional goal, and shape how you do it to support the goal. \[Ed.: I often brag on behalf of founders who we've invested in, to elevate their achievements, tagging [\#proudinvestor](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23proudinvestor%20%40roybahat&src=typed_query&f=live). Or I point to somebody on our team to direct the brag in a way that supports that goal.\]

Also think about how your brag is going to read. Sometimes it's going to read like bragging. **There can be a price to bragging, but you can't succeed without paying prices.** Ask if you are getting more value than the price that you paid. If your goal is to never be looked at askance, you'll never brag. And you will be fighting with one arm tied behind your back compared to all the people who can.  


#### [I work at a company and am building a startup on the side. Should I be public about what I am doing?](https://www.pscp.tv/w/ccqLiTFsWktwWXhYSnhvam58MVBsSlFObFBEZHZ4RV4L2mx1WQ5LtJx8yyoqkHwNQCgJ1Xu_UiCXhsGgYBKq)

Know your company's views on this: at some companies, they want you to stay absolutely quiet on social media. There are companies that don't care. If you work for a company that will fire you for tweeting anything, and you like working at that company,  maybe you should not tweet. Make a judgment.

And then there's you, how do you want to approach being public?There's no mandate to build a public profile for yourself. Plenty of wildly successful people have done without.

This is a "horses for courses" issue where you have to find your own way. If your reason for building a profile is for the sake of having a profile, that usually doesn't work. If your reason for building a profile is you genuinely want to express something and engage with people, that's great. 

You have to be savvy about how you do it. Try to be public a little bit at a time and see how it goes. Know which issues are hot buttons for your employer.

\[Ed.: I run a venture capital fund that carries the name of a person who spent decades building his reputation. I respect that. I try to use judgment about when it would affect his reputation for me to express myself. I'll go to a communications person at my company and ask, "If I say this thing, will it cause issues?" And sometimes the answer is yes, it will cause issues, and I say it anyway, because it's that important. And sometimes the answer is, "Yes, it's going to cause issues," and I think twice.\] 

Too often people, when they're unsure how to handle a tricky situation like being public about their private projects, resort to absolutes. "Well, I should never say anything," or, "I should have an unambiguous right to say whatever I wish." The world just doesn't work that way. Develop the tradecraft of knowing when and how. Ask for feedback as you go.



#### [What do I do if a journalist contacts me for an interview?](https://www.pscp.tv/w/cc0iNDFsWktwWXhYSnhvam58MXZBR1JyallxZGdHbH6AqBmFHNbaxRKDu7pG3HHksNtW0tO6kOmHzQIcq9E0)

**Why is the journalist contacting you?** A journalist is a professional doing a job, which is to report on things that are interesting. They're trying to figure out how to write a useful story to reach their audience. \(They're generally not reaching out to do you a favor -- so try to figure out what their "angle" is on their story.\) 

There are rules of engagement and etiquette for how journalists generally approach things. Years ago,  a PR person at a company might connect you with a journalist and mediate the covnersation. Now you migh get a DM out of the blue from a journalist. "Hey, I write for \[some publication\] I'd like to talk to you about your experience with \[suchandsuch\]. Can we talk?" You might be terrified -- many people are in that moment -- because you're not quite sure what to do.

Try reading the journalist's prior work and figure out if you like it. Do you think they say useful and interesting things? And once you have a picture in your head, think to yourself: does it serve my interest to build a relationship with this journalist and talk to them about this story? It's about more than that one story. 

**You can ask the journalist questions to see if you want to talk.** You could say, "I haven't spoken to a journalist before. I'm curious, how does this work?" And oftentimes this should-we-talk exchange now happens in writing, over DM or email or text. You can even ask, "Is it possible for me to talk to you without being named in your story?" You can come to some agreement with a journalist, particularly if they've reached out to you. You can say you'd like to speak freely, so it would help if you could have the conversation off the record -- or you can ask, if they want to quote you, for them to run the quote by you first. If you don't agree that the conversation is [off the record or on background](https://www.ap.org/about/news-values-and-principles/telling-the-story/anonymous-sources), they are allowed to use anything you say to them. Agree on the terms of the discussion before you begin talking. After you've said something you regret, it's too late.

Anything you put in a journalist's inbox is fair game. Executives sometimes write to a journalist unsolicited and say, "We're announcing our new product on Tuesday." And then the journalist might write about the product on Tuesday without talking to them.

If you work at a big company, you need to know the rules of engagement for your company. Some companies won't let employees talk to journalists. If you company allows you to speak with a journalist, you can always \(and probably should\) check in with a communications professional at the company \(i.e., a PR person\).

**Once you're speaking with the journalist, try to have one idea you want to get across** -- and have it be something that fits what they're writing about. This is another example of "it's about them, not about you." Share stories, examples, evidence that supports your idea. Let the journalist ask you a bunch of questions.

Anticipate hard questions in advance -- a good journalist might try and catch you off guard. It's within their rights to do that -- they're trying to get at the truth. You can say "I don't feel comfortable talking about it." While journalists aren't there to puff you up or do you favors, if you understand how they work you can partner with them to get truth out there about what you're doing at work.
