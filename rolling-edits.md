\*\*\*\*[**How should we split equity among the co-founders?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1BdxYnEeABXKX)

There is no one right answer to how to split equity shares among co-founders, but it is important to consider all the factors that can influence this decision and to include these factors in your conversation about sharing equity.

How you should split equity among co-founders is an important decision that you shouldn’t take lightly. It is important as, firstly, if you regret your decision later, it can be hard to fix and secondly, your views on the subject will probably change-- when the person who you thought was going to be really valuable turns out to be a dud, you will have to manage that and deal with the fact that their shares don’t reflect their involvement.

When people approach equity shares, they usually have a conversation that is purely about those equity shares. Really, the conversation should be about much more. In addition to equity shares, you can also talk about how much money the person has, what role money plays in their life, what role a feeling of ownership plays, how much control over what happens is involved, and how important identity is. All of these things play important roles in the division of equity.

Something that can help you ask these critical questions is [The Partnership Charter,](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/235803.The_Partnership_Charter), where psychologist and business mediation expert David Gage offers a comprehensive guide to the art of establishing and maintaining a partnership. The charter works for everything from marriages to business partnerships, and talking through the questions and answering them can benefit startup founders too. Asking the full inventory of important questions can be really hard, so starting with the Partnership Charter can be useful.

Once you have gone through the questions, you can identify the factors that should influence your decision. There is no one-size-fits-all for sharing equity, for some 50-50 works out well, whilst others can benefit from more unusual splits, like Uber who gave 90% to founders who weren't even full-time with the business.

Deciding on a number is a process of triangulation, and ideally you want to get to a place where everybody's feelings are known, regardless of whether they are happy or unhappy, and you can work with everyone’s feelings as things unfold.

With startups, long vesting periods can be beneficial. The market standard is a four-year vest, meaning you earn into your shares over four years. Founders typically don't have the "cliff" where an employee will vest over four years, but not get anything until the end of year one when they get a year all at once. Founders generally vest all the way through. Long vesting periods can seem daunting, but when you think about the fact that companies generally take a decade to succeed, having a 10-year vest doesn't seem that crazy. These long vests triangulate with many factors. It's not just about the money, or the fairness, or any one factor. It's about all of them, and you need to use the conversation about equity to get them on the table.

You probably won’t care about your vesting period and equity shares unless you find yourself in the scenario where the company has been successful, but you only stayed for a while and then you got pushed out or left. In this case, you're probably going to end up having your stake renegotiated for you anyways. The next investor is going to say, "I don't want this person who's no longer involved at 15%, so as a condition of my investment, you need to go renegotiate that."

Sharing equity is not just about money, it also involves other factors. In order to cover these factors in your conversation, you can ask questions and figure out how everyone is feeling.

\*\*\*\*[**My company is growing. How do I keep track of what's going on?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1ynKOqDDjoQJR)\*\*\*\*

As your company grows, you might find that you are no longer able to keep track of what is going on and stay on top of everything. Once you have accepted this, you can focus on staying on top of the important things, which can be identified using a sensing system.

The first part of this answer is: don't try and know everything that is going on. Instead of trying to stay on top of everything, solve the problem by coming to the realization that you can’t stay on top of everything. Struggling to manage everything is common when your company grows and you hire more people to get leverage. With this growth, you’re probably going to need to operate at a different level of structure. Bringing more people on means that you are going to need to get comfortable with not knowing, and let your team do what they were hired to do. 

The second part directly follows the first part: if you know that you aren’t going to pay attention to everything, how will you pay attention to the right things? 

A way to make sure that you know about the right things is to have a sensing system in place. A sensing system will tell you when something goes wrong, or especially right, and will draw your attention to what needs input from you. Your sensing system can be through software, human processes, or interactions with different people. What form your sensing system takes is not important, as long as it allows you to understand the complex organism that is your company.

\[Ed.: When Dan was at Medium, the team grew to a size where he could no longer know what each team member was doing. Dan felt that he didn’t know much about what his Eng team was up to, and so when it came to reporting their progress to the Exec team, he didn’t have much to share. 

He then started having those Eng teams try and send him a report on Friday that he could then relate to the Exec team. But unfortunately, this wasn’t successful as noone wanted to report to him just for the sake of reporting to him. 

So, he ended up creating a sensing system that could broadcast information to the whole company. Instead of team members giving information to him, he facilitated the flow of  information to the rest of the company. He was then able to highlight their work and represent it to the company through the weekly engineering report.\]

Creating a broadcasting system like Dan’s is one way to set up a sensing system, but really what you need are rituals and cadence. The sensing system is built on top of rituals, and they have to be weekly, daily, monthly, and yearly. You can then build up that cadence of communication. 

One way to incorporate a ritual is by using Range. If your team checks in with you routinely, you can assess how they are answering the team question and how their mood is. You can use these things to decide if you should look at something in more detail and go into their day-to-day work. Noticing when your team members aren’t acting as they usually do can allow you to be alerted when they are struggling or need more support. 

You may think that a sensing system is about dealing with information that is present, but it is actually also about dealing with the absence of information. Oftentimes, when people on a team are struggling, they stop being forthcoming in their communication. In these cases, you take notice of the absence of information. If someone you usually hear from every day suddenly goes quiet, that is your signal that something may be wrong. 

As your company increases in size, you probably aren’t going to be able to know everything that is going on in your company. Instead, you can strive to know the important things, which a sensing system can help bring to your attention.

\*\*\*\*[**Can I change my company name?**](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1MnGndwoeZyxO)

If you believe that changing your company name is the best thing for your business, the process of doing so is challenging and long, but still entirely possible. 

\[Ed.: Spike is the founder of "Newfront", which was once called “Abe Insurance.” There are a number of reasons why you may want to change your name, but for Spike, the fact that many people thought Abe was an acronym and that he was associated with Shinzo Abe was reason enough.\]

There may not be one instance that makes you decide, “Okay, it’s time to change our company name.” But if there has been an accumulation of consumer conversations where your name was identified as something that they can’t relate to or deterred them in some way, you might want to consider changing it. \[For Spike, one of these conversations included a broker telling him that he would join their company in spite of their name.\]

If you decide that it is necessary to change your name, you might be tempted to delay the process for as long as possible. Like exercise, changing your name can become something that stays at the back of your mind. You know you need to do it, but you never get around to actually doing it. 

There are many approaches you can take when trying to come up with a new name. You might choose to speak to someone who has experience with company names, who will ask you questions like, "Imagine how the name makes you feel." \[Ed.: Although this may work for some people, Spike believes that they spent too long doing this.\] Alternatively, you could get creative and try combining words to create a name. 

No matter what approach you take, if you are selling or working in an existing market, you will probably come to the realization that almost every name is already taken. This may not be a problem if you're in crypto, but if you, like Spike, are working in a well-developed market like insurance, you will see that in order to have something unique, you will have to make up a name that isn’t an existing word or something that you would usually think of.

You may decide to change the name of the corporation or just your DBA, "doing business as" name. Your decision may be based on personal reasons, or legal reasons which sometimes require you to change the name of your corporation. Once you have picked the name for your corporation or DBA, the process of actually changing the name starts. If your company is already well-established and you are regulated by multiple states, have many licenses or have trading partners who you have legal relationships with, the process of changing your name can be a long and laborious one. \[Ed.: Spike’s law firm gave him a 2 page checklist to make the process easier. You can find it here.\]

You will see some things on the checklist that you probably would never have thought of. One of them is the fact that a lot of things are on payroll, especially if you have employees in multiple states. Something else to consider is if you are involved in a lawsuit, you will have to notify the courts of your name change. 

Another thing that can make the process difficult is if those you work with have different processes for updating their contracts. 

Once you have legally changed your name, you can begin to update your platform. This can be particularly challenging if you already have a complex product with your old name written all over it. An important aspect of this is securing a new domain. It isn’t always necessary to have a domain that matches your company’s name, but if it is for you, it might be best to secure it early so you don’t end up spending large sums of money buying it from someone. 

The process of changing your company’s name is undoubtedly a hassle \[Ed.: one that lasted about 6 months for Spike\], but it is something that can build value in the company in the long term.

**DAY 111**

**What do I do if my co-founder and I disagree on our company vision?**

Roy Bahat:

Welcome. This is not advice. Still, I'm Roy Bahat and I'm here with Minn Kim, who is my co-host, and together we are a startup investors in the future of work.

Minn Kim:

And every day we're answering questions of yours about work. Today is day 111, and we're breaking down some questions around, I think this is one that comes up pretty frequently, and so what do I do if my co-founder and I disagree on what our company vision should be?

Roy Bahat:

What do I do? Minn, I feel like this is one you've had to unpack many times. My starter on this is that, you've heard that expression that people break up a band over creative differences, and sometimes that's really what happens is some disagreement over this thing. Usually, it's actually about something else. It's almost always about something else. And the reason it's almost always about something else is that co-founder relationships are so multi-faceted and complex. They're personal and intense. They are about money. They're about your workday. They're about your family life and how it integrates in your family life and social life. They're about what the company's strategy should be. They're about ethics. They're about lots and lots of things and some of those things are more comfortable to talk about than other things, and we tend to gravitate toward making arguments about the easiest thing to talk about.

Roy Bahat:

And so, I guess my response is the first thing to do is figure out what are you really having a difference over? Is it really over that? And just interview each other \[inaudible 00:01:43\] partnership charter in past episodes, but interviewing each other about, interview is maybe a strong word, about how are you thinking about this, that, the other thing? And then ultimately, if you discover that what you really have is a strong difference in, let's not use an abstract word like vision, let's just say what the company should do in order to succeed, then you try to work out and see the best in each other.

Roy Bahat:

Ultimately, there can only be one set of actions that the company takes, maybe a portfolio of actions. And then sometimes it's like, okay, well, who has the power? Who thinks they're right and who has the power? If you can't convince each other, then it gets settled by who has more equity or you may need to push the other person out. You've had to go through it escalating. This is another one of these cases where disagreement, you start with trying to resolve it and then you quickly escalate through a series of actions that can culminate, if it's ultimately that important, in pushing the other person out.

Minn Kim:

Yeah. And I think this question presupposes that there is a vision, which I think there's a difference between mission and the thing that you and your co-founder care a lot about, and then vision is a totally different thing, which is like end success. It could end up being a lot of different things. And so, to your point around figuring out what does it you're actually arguing about, probably makes sense because vision, especially when you're early, is so amorphous and ambiguous.

Roy Bahat:

\[inaudible 00:03:12\] what commitment do we want to make to our investors? That's the thing to argue about because you might be morally obligated to that commitment. Anyway, so yes, I love that. Thank you, Minn.

Minn Kim:

Of course. And so, that was not advice given from Roy and Minn from Bloomberg Beta. If you have other questions you want us to answer, we'll be back tomorrow and then we will be off Thursday and Friday for those of us in the U.S. celebrating Thanksgiving.

Roy Bahat:

Yeah. Remember, the reason we're not giving you advice is we want you to live your life, not ours, and to be continued.

Minn Kim:

To be continued.

**DAY 112**

**How much do the holidays matter in timing my fundraise?**

Roy:

Every day, including today, the day before Thanksgiving in the US, Minn and I, both startup investors, answer one of your questions about work.

Minn:

And today is day 112, and we're going to be breaking down, I think, a question that's come up a couple times recently, given that Thanksgiving is tomorrow. But for if I'm an early stage founder, how much do the holidays matter in timing my fundraise?

Roy:

It used to matter a lot. My sense is that basically, in the world where there were only a few VC firms, and they were very fancy, and big fancy offices that looked like law firms, they would take off the month of August, and ski a week. And for sure, Thanksgiving and Christmas, things slow down. And so, there was conventional wisdom then, which by the way, plenty of great companies raised in the middle of the holidays, and great firms invested in the middle of the holidays. So, I don't know that it was universally true, but it did seem, back then, that there was some truth to this idea that timing, the annual timing mattered. And I will say that for us now at Bluebird Beta, part of this month has been grueling in part because it's an intense investing month. There just seems to be a lot happening.

Roy:

That said, the answer is if you're an early stage founder, meaning like you're raising your first institutional money of some form, certainly angel money, it does not matter. Raise as soon as you can get money from good people who you trust. As you know, man, I've got that sticker on my laptop, TTFM, take the fucking money, meaning people you trust on fair terms and how you define fair terms, that's part of the whole game, take the money, seek the money whenever you can and obviously what \[inaudible 00:01:43\] different data, how far along do I need to be to start to get institutional money. But if you are far enough along to do it, don't stress the calendar,

Minn:

Right. Because I think especially again, early stage is different than if you're a fast growing series B and beyond kind of company. But also I think that it matters not as much at the early stage in part because there's the diligence on an investor side is also not something that will take months, right? It's in the order of days and weeks. And so even if you started last week and Thanksgiving is this week, that week isn't going to make or break a huge difference.

Roy:

Totally agreed. So raise one's good for you and relieve yourself. One of the most valuable things we do at startup investors is, hey founder, you're super stressed about X, what if you didn't have to be stressed about X? There are plenty of other things that you should stress about, maybe not that.

Minn:

Totally. So that's sound advice given, if you have a question you want us to answer reply to us here.

Roy:

And I would just say the reason that this is not advice is because we continue to believe people will give you advice that telling you how to live their life, we want you to live yours. And we will be back on Monday, we're taking on the rest of this week off for the holiday, for more of your questions. To be continued.

Minn:

Grateful for you.

Roy:

I'm grateful for you Minn. Thank you, really. I'm feeling more stressed than gratitude at the moment, despite that, I can see very clearly my gratitude for getting to work with you, so thank you.

Minn:

Thank you. Okay. Talk to you soon.

Roy:

Bye.

**+++**

**DAY 113**

**Someone wants to buy my company. Should I engage?**

Roy:

Minn and I are startup investors and we're here every day answering a question of yours work.

Minn:

And today is day 113. Today. We had some big news. At least I woke up to some big news. So I don't know, Salesforce about Slack and Facebook acquiring another small early stage company called Customer. And so this topic I think is one that comes up frequently with some of the founders that we've worked with before as well.

Roy:

Yeah.

Minn:

And so if someone wants to buy my company and they reach out, what should I do? Should I engage?

Roy:

Well first congratulations on somebody wanting to buy your company. That's exciting, or at least expressing that they want to buy it. As very modest investors in Slack, if that is what Stuart and the team want, we support whatever ultimately what the founders want. The first question is just asking yourself where are you on this? And maybe the answer often is you don't know, meaning maybe there is a price at which I would be bought and I don't know. And figuring out whether or not the acquisition interest is substantial enough to be worth exploring is part of the game.

Roy:

The first step is, do you know what you want? And maybe you do, maybe you don't, but at least you just check in with yourself. Then the next question is well, okay who is the company? And Minn, you were raising like, okay it's Facebook. You know that's legit. But oftentimes the interests come from some company I haven't heard of. And the answer is do a little research. Poke a little bit. And if you haven't heard of them and you can't find things about them online, that's a really bad sign. Now it doesn't mean you shouldn't engage, but it does mean you need to compensate for it by making them pre-qualify their interest.

Roy:

And then the last thing is who is the person who is reaching out because big companies often have a corporate development team that all they do all day long is say hey, we'd like to talk to you, including a potentially about an acquisition. And what that can mean is we got assigned to make a landscape slide, everybody who's in the some space is that you're in, the space the customer is in. And we just want to fill in that acquisition slide and we're talking to you. And then all of a sudden you have founders who are like, drop everything and talk to this, I hate to say it, person who just executing orders in corporate development.

Roy:

And so I think that the critical question once know whether you know what you want is figure out why is this person reaching out to me? And if this person is a person in corporate development, then what we usually say is okay, they're reaching out to you probably because either they're doing research or somebody specifically asked them. If they're doing research, you probably don't want to just help them building a relationship with cork development. I've never seen a company that's like, I can't. I'm so grateful I built that relationship with corporate development. I say this having done this work before, that it helped me get acquired, not that helpful.

Roy:

But if they're asking behalf of somebody, then it can be very helpful because you could get on the phone and say, or even email. You don't even need to go on the phone and be like, oh I'm just curious what's behind the request. And we're a small startup or busy, which is true. Your time is really precious. The single riskiest thing that can happen is they just burn a bunch of your time. And so you can just go back to them and say, was this something that a specific person or business unit was interested in?

Roy:

And the most frequent success case when corp dev reaches out to initiate a conversation is that the recipient, the company that might be acquired, uses that outreach to parlay it into a business relationship with the right executive at the company. If you already have one, you can go back to them and ask. And if you don't, you can be like, well it'd be great to meet with your head of customer success and talk about how we might work together, because you can often find a commercial partnership is a more valuable way to work together than acquisition.

Roy:

So it's do you know what you want? What does the company? Do some research. If they don't seem legit, ask them questions about themselves. I'm sorry. I can't \[inaudible 00:03:55\]. Can you tell me more? And if it seems fishy, it's fishy. End of story, full stop. And just the fact that it's so exciting if it works is sometimes not enough.

Roy:

The last piece is who is the person and what is their local interest for reaching out to you? And how do you best understand that? So that's the tip of the iceberg on responding. I don't know, Minn. You've had these conversations many times with founders. What do you think?

Minn:

Yeah. And I think the first point about, well so if you've been operating in a particular domain for a long time, you probably already know who your near neighbors are already and who the Goliaths are versus what you're trying to do. And so I think having that in context as well also determines how you want to engage with them. Is it a direct competitor? In which case that could be great, or depending on who it is at that organization, that could be not so great or potentially cause more, maybe you want to defer that for a while.

Roy:

Yeah. I think this is a specific example of our general thing, that there is no them at the company. There is that specific person and what their interests are as opposed to just the company's interest overall. So yes. Thank you for teasing it out. Yeah.

Minn:

Great. Well, it is good to be back, post the Thanksgiving long weekend for many of us in the US and we'll be back tomorrow.

Roy:

Yeah. To be continued.

Minn:

To be continued.

Roy:

Thank you Minn.

Minn:

Thanks.

**How much does due diligence on my investors matter, and how do I do that?**

\[Guest: [Harrison Donahue, Senior Partner @ VCG Research](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrison-donahue-2278871b6/)\]

Roy:

Related to secret identity guests. Here \[crosstalk 00:00:04\] and I, we're startup investors and we answer a question or, in this case, a guest answers one of your questions about work. Today's day one 16, and we've got a special guest who we have cajoled into showing up, even if you will only give us Pekichu, who is Harrison, the founder of VC Guide, which many of us in the startup ecosystem saw emerge in the last few months as a review site for VC's that also releases other products for founders, but has real talk from founders sharing what their actual experiences are. And these things are very tricky because with protected identities, you both get more honesty and lots of complexity. And so we want to talk about a complex subject here with Harrison, and that is, presumably, the way that founders use VC Guide, is as a tool to do diligence about investors, to figure out who to reach and whether to work with them. So let's just start with, how much does that even matter? How much does diligence in your investors matter?

Harrison:

Yeah. Well, I mean, first of all, thanks to the both of you for having me on, right. And having a random avatar on your talk show. But I think, especially these days, it matters a lot, right? Venture capital... I think one thing that we believe as a team is venture capitals and asset classes changing super rapidly. And actually we're finding ourselves in the most founder-friendly market that I think I've seen in my lifetime. And so with so many different emerging fund managers, so many different investors, the really big question that I think a lot of founders should ask is, "Okay, you know what, who would be an active value-add to my cap table." Right? And so I think long answer short, which is, it matters a lot, but of course it varies a lot per stage.

Harrison:

Are they a board member? Are they a large cheque? Are they a minority investor? Right? And then, I think when it comes to VC Guide, one thing that we actively try to encourage every founder to look at it as is, hopefully VC Guide is one of 10,000 data points you take into account, right? Hopefully you would never rely on a Yelp review for financing your entire business. And so we tell everyone, "Hey, look, take everything with a grain of salt", but also I think traditionally founders have come up with pretty creative ways to do due dil on their investors. Right. So I think our very networked founders can of course, "quote on quote", back channel with other founder friends, right. They'll ask their founder friends, "Hey, what do you think about this investor? How do you feel? Have you worked with them?" And a lot of this happens in real life conversations or text or Twitter DMs, right, what have you.

Harrison:

But then I think the majority of founders don't come the Valley, right? And so, then they need to be much more, I think, active in their research. And so I think there are certain signals that you can look at, right? What content has this investor produced? A lot of investors these days are actually becoming their own content creators, and also creating their own distribution channels. And so I think a content that investor produces, whether it be their own podcast or blog posts, are great signals for, potentially, whether or not this investor aligns with your company thesis. Right. And also, I think there are certain questions that you should ask the investor yourself when you're on a pitch meeting. Right? So do you have a built-in audience, right? How do you drive distribution for your portfolio companies? Right. Are you an expert in something that you could teach us as a course? Right. Can you refer me to other portfolio founders of yours? And let me talk to them.

Harrison:

I've heard a lot of founders who are in the VCG community bring these up. But also there are certain questions that I would not only ask the investor, but I'd also ask myself, which is, "After spending a X amount of time with this investor, can I imagine myself building this business without them?" Right. And in a very ideal world, you would spend a significant amount of time with an investor before you work with them, just like you date someone for a long time before you marry them. Right? But also, we live in COVID. So I realized the world is crazy and a lot of pitch meetings are happening over zoom right now. And so anyways, that is my super long answer to the question.

Roy:

Okay, great. I mean, it's great. \[Min 00:00:04:32\], it looks like you're about to say something.

Min:

Yeah, no I mean I think there's that element of transparency that you're talking about Harrison, which is one of, for certainly, one of our biggest values and Roy, I do want to hear your perspective because you've written like a whole blog post about why founders should and how they can reference their investors.

Roy:

I mean, I'll pick up on Harrison's point that you should only take them if you can't imagine building the company without them. Ideally, obviously sometimes you just need money and there's one person who he wants to give you money and you just need to figure out, are they an axe murderer or not. Different realities to it, but I think one of the real top challenges is raising money sucks. It's tiring. It's like this important thing that's in other people's hands. And by the time you get to having an offer, there's often such a profound sense of relief that you just want it to be over with. So you actually, at that point, really only want to hear good things. My fear is that many founders miss. I think most founder's underdo it on reference checking, their VCs, diligencing with tools like VC Guide, just doing their outside-in homework, even Google searching the name of the person to make sure if they were accused of something awful, at least you know about stuff like that and then you can ask them about it.

Roy:

Most founder's underdo it, I think. And it is like hiring somebody except that it's very hard to fire them. So however many references you do on a hire, however much research and diligence you do, what would you do if it were irreversible? And I really respect that tension. We're in it now with several companies who are like, they want to finish out their round, but they also don't want axe murderers on their cap table. And so you just got to balance and find your way. And I think the more tools, the better. It's why we're grateful for what you've been building a VC Guide. Although, I'm sure at some point, I mean look, you know me, I got a pretty defined bluntness. At some point somebody's going to be like "This guy's a fucking asshole" and how to respond to that. And the answer might be, "Okay, \[inaudible 00:06:47\] an asshole." I don't know.

Roy:

And I'll just say, just to everybody in the community, Harrison's done a great job of giving \[inaudible 00:06:55\] and responding well here. If you have other questions for him, he is findable on Twitter and you should follow there, because as I said, it's not just this review guy, they're also rolling out other products and there are exciting announcements that you can follow, if you chase them there. And I think that's what we got for today. Anything else, \[Min 00:00:07:14\]?

Min:

No, love that. So thank you so much, Harrison, and we hope that you'll come back on at some point.

Roy:

Ask questions. Ask more questions. That's our fuel. Feed us questions. And I'm wearing my Hanukkah sweater because tonight is Startup Festivus which, if you followed our Twitter, you saw this is our event for all the startups that are too small, new, lonely, something to throw their own holiday party. It's too late now, if you didn't already request your invitation, but look out for it for next year. And yeah, my daughter was a little sad that I'm not going to be finished until late tonight, but time of year, enjoy our community with other \[inaudible 00:07:52\]. So to be continued.

Min:

To be continued. Thanks, Harrison.

Harrison:

All right. Thanks for having me talk to you all soon. Bye.

\*\*DAY 117

How do I set boundaries on how much I work when there's always more to get done?\*\*

Roy:

Time for another one of your questions about work. And if you're new, we are startup investors, and everyday we answer a question about the future of work.

Minn:

And today is day 117. We've been answering stuff. Stuff questions that you have and today... This is probably one that's been top of mind for a lot of people that I've talked to this week. But how do I set boundaries on how much I work when there's always more to get done?

Roy:

Yeah. I feel it in particular, I'm about to do a session with somebody who is very active. She's a nonprofit founder who's very active around advocacy issues in the election. Particularly if you're working on something that has broader social consequences, it's so easy to just convince yourself there's more to do. Minn and I were talking before, and I think we both feel a little bit of pot calling the kettle black, even trying to answer this question, because I only do okay at this in my own life and I feel inconsistent about it. So admission of guilt.

Roy:

I'll share two different ways that I have seen people manage it. And I think that there is no one right answer. A lot of it depends on the phase in life that you're in, and what your goal is. One way is I call the, when the work is done well enough standard, where people set a standard of like, "Here's what I want to try to do. I want to make this kind of progress. I got to work as hard as is necessary within reason to get there."

Roy:

Now what ends up happening is if you start to burn yourself out, you adjust the standard a little bit, or you've more effectively changed the scope of like, "I'll do fewer things". So that's one way, but that can lead to intense burnout because you have less control on a day-to-day basis over exactly how much you do.

Roy:

The method that I try to use and I'm not trying to say it's right, is the "I'm going to set a box." And that box is how much effort I'm willing to give to work, relative to other things that I prioritize in my life. My family, caring for myself, I try to put those things ahead. I'm not always as successful as I wish I were. And then, hey it's like, if I'm going to miss that deal because I didn't have the ninth hour to work in that day, on some level you have to say that's the price of doing what you want.

Roy:

And a good friend of mine who now runs a hedge fund, an economist named Jonathan Tepper once said, "The problem with success isn't that people don't know how to achieve, it's that most people are unwilling to pay the price." And what he meant there was a certain kind of professional success. And I guess the thing I just say is, it's about knowing what you're willing to sacrifice and those are two juristics that you can use.

Roy:

I think the second one is healthier for me now at this point in my life. Would it always have been the right answer? I don't know, but that's how I think about it. It's set the box, stick to the box.

Minn:

Yeah. One of the things that helps for me is, I often think of the two-by-two of important, not important, and then along one axis and then urgent, less urgent on the other axis. And then I try to spend some time thinking about it. When I'm feeling overwhelmed, I'll think about the four quadrants and I'll ask myself what is important and urgent, which means like... And typically that's being prompt about getting back to somebody in time about something that is live or that they need an answer, right?

Minn:

And then there's stuff that's not as important, but equally urgent, because your teammate needs something from you. Or if there's a deadline that we need to meet and I'm accountable for some part of it, even if I'm not responsible, right? For the entire project. And so those two are always a constant juggle, but they're both important or rather they both take up time and need to get done.

Minn:

And then I think the hardest part is more around the important, but less urgent things that people do want to spend time. And I think is often sometimes some of the most fulfilling work in your day. And I think setting the boundaries to make time for those things is to your point, Roy, something has to give, and maybe that's the price to pay if you want to spend time doing the important, less urgent thing.

Roy:

Yeah. I love that. And I mean the book, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, I don't remember any of the habits other than the important versus urgent chapter. And I highly recommend if people have time that they take a look at it because... Or chapters, I can't remember, because it's really... I mean, I think it's a wonderful way to look at the world.

Roy:

My last observation on it is that line evolves over the course of your career, or even over the course of a year. Especially if you're doing a startup where things changing quickly, something you would've considered to be important last month, it changes. So it's a timing dosage thing too.

Minn:

Totally.

Roy:

Always.

Minn:

Sound advice. Not kidding. If you have other questions that you want us to answer reply to us here.

Roy:

And the reason this is not advice is because our view is that people who give advice are usually telling you how you should live their life or run their business, and we want you to live your own. So we'll be back tomorrow with a guest, a former student of mine. I'm very excited about that. To be continued.

Minn:

To be continued.

Roy:

Thank you, Minn.

Minn:

Thank you.

**+++**

**DAY 118**

**How do I take a break without feeling guilty about my career progression?**

\[Guest: Hady Berry\]

Roy:

All right. It is time for another one of your questions about work. I'm Roy, I'm a startup investor in the future of work. Usually, I'm here with Minn. Today's day I think 118. And today, we've got a special guest who is going to ask our question today. So our special guest is Hady Berry, who I first met when she was my student in the course that I teach every year at Haas, at Berkeley's business school. And in that course, people make media. And I still talk to this day about the podcast that she made, \[inaudible 00:00:32\], it was called The Love and the Age of Minder, about dating in the context of being a Muslim in a modern community, that's diverse and lots of folks. And then I tracked her career, she went... Most recently was at Zipline, working... Are you still in Côte d'Ivoire right now?

Hady:

I am actually. I'm in Abidjan right now. Yeah.

Roy:

And she was there. She's really interested in companies that are doing innovative things focused on Africa. And she's got a question that's a big one for lots of folks. I'm going to turn it over to you Hady to ask the question.

Hady:

Hi, Roy. It's a pleasure to be here. So my question is a big, big one for me right now. It is how do I take a break without feeling guilty about my career progression? And that's a space where I am right now.

Roy:

I think there are... So do you mean a break between jobs in that case? Or do you mean a break like when I'm overworked and I just need a few days off or both?

Hady:

So I think it's almost a break when you decide that you just wanted to take a break from working or you don't have an idea of when you're going to enter the workspace again. And you \[crosstalk 00:01:36\] to do with like burnout.

Roy:

So look, the first thing I said, I've had a couple episodes like this in my career. I detailed them on LinkedIn. I called them unemployed, happily and unemployed, unhappily. And for different reasons. But you're describing the situation where somebody has the opportunity to decide to pause. First of all, I'll just say it's different depending on everything from like how wealthy you are, race, gender got a factor into it in ways that I can't fully understand, privilege of all forms. So I'm just going to share my experience, which is... I think there's two aspects to it.

Roy:

One is the practical kind of trade craft of like, okay, I want a break or I need a break, whether it's mental health, or I just want to think about things. For whatever your reasons are, how do you craft your return, assuming you want to return to something professional?

Roy:

And it could be... Obviously moms go through this in a certain way. And I think there's a basic thing, which is just thinking through imagining what that return may be like really helps a lot. What I mean by that is, if you're like, "Okay, I'm going to take six months off, and then there's going to be a tough conversation." Because people would be like, "Why did you take six months off?" But I'll address it by doing XYZ. Just gaming it out in your head can both the generate strategy for you, including... When you take time off, there's some important choices you make, like what identity do you wear to the world? I've missed that you had left Zipline, for example. \[inaudible 00:03:06\] my time off, I knew what I was going to do after that. So it was easier, but I changed my LinkedIn title to doing nothing. Because my goal there was for them not to bother me. But if, instead my goal was, I do want to hear from them, then I might've changed it to something else. I might've changed it to like one of those, looking for a blank kind of thing.

Roy:

So there's some trade craft around the planning of what \[inaudible 00:03:32\] do while you're out, how you imagine being back? Don't you think that's helpful?

Roy:

For me for the core of question, which is the inner experience. Like that plan helps calm my inner experience. And then the guilt to me is... Managing one's inner life is the most underrated professional skill. Ben Horowitz has that thing about the hardest part of being CEO is managing your own psychology. Yes, CEO is a tough job like that. But hardest part of being anybody, professionally or otherwise is managing your own psychology.

Roy:

And so then I just get out like, "Okay, well, what is driving that?" Do you have a hypothesis on what's driving that? Is it because you just have a tendency toward guilt? Which many of us... I do, many of us do. In which case that is then an issue to work on? Is it about some feeling? And I'll ask you, Hady you for you about, is there some specific thing driving it, but there's a diagnosis. And then a response, be the scientist operating on yourself. Which if you're in a position to be able to do it... Mental health professionals are awesome with that, like my therapist, my coach, all very, very helpful in this. But that's the practice to be in, is self-diagnosis and response. It sounds like you have some specific things \[crosstalk 00:04:41\] .

Hady:

Absolutely. I think for me it was with the pandemic. My job used to involve a lot travel, and beginning of March, I got to not travel at all, and be in a place for more than two weeks at a time. And that got me very interested in rest and how much better I felt now that I didn't have to travel. It made me realize that I never used to think of rest as something quite radical or quite important. And that was trying to think away, how do I keep these epiphany with me and do something with it?

Hady:

And ultimately I just never found a way to weave it into the pace at which I worked. And I think that's something personal, like the relationship to work, the value we get some work kind of superseded the important service in my life. And so for me \[crosstalk 00:05:28\] to stop working, than \[inaudible 00:05:31\].

Roy:

I didn't mean to interrupt you, but I was trying to get at what is the source of the guilt then?

Hady:

It's probably being like child of immigrants. It's just like in her early '30s, I'm tired of working. Whereas my parents are still working. What right do you actually have to take a break? So that's part of it. Yeah.

Roy:

Yeah, yeah.

Hady:

\[inaudible 00:05:52\] of it.

Roy:

There's such a world of around this. I'll just say, I really applaud your knowledge of yourself. What I hear in that is you saying like, "Oh, I wish I could have rested." We should have put up the nap ministry, it's a great resource. I wish I could rested at work. It just didn't work for me.

Roy:

I think most professionals assume that they'll be judged to a degree that they will not be, or it's like, "Yeah, \[inaudible 00:06:16\]." It's a price you're going to pay. Now easier for me to say than maybe somebody at a different point in their career. But I wish I had been able to say that to myself and believed it back in an earlier point in my career.

Roy:

And then you have all the like, "Well, I can have a job and lots of people can't who am I to do this?" Or my parents, I mean \[crosstalk 00:06:34\] my parents might think XYZ. And I think that the critical thing there is not... Just because somebody else has suffered, doesn't mean you suffering makes the world any better. And I think it's true for a lot of things under COVID right now. It's like... Look, I'm fortunate to have a job. I feel guilty sometimes struggling with my own work. Because it's like, "Hey, what the fuck does this guy got to have to complain about?" And the answer is nothing. And me sublimating, burying, ignoring my own inner life doesn't help anybody else who doesn't have a job feel better. So I'm going to work on me. That's all I have.

Roy:

I think you can do the same thing, you can if you want to. And I think it's a courageous thing to identify it. And just name it as a price. Like, "Hey, my parents might be mad." Does that make it wrong? Not necessarily. You may have talked to them about it, but that's a price to be aware of and to potentially pay.

Roy:

And I kind of think of it with all these things is, it's not, you can, or you can't, and you should or you shouldn't, it's, there's a price to pay, can you minimize this? Can you identify it? Do you want to pay it? And if you want to pay it, because it's worth it, because you're worth it, then I think is beautiful. Anyway, that's \[inaudible 00:07:46\]. Again, not advice, because I won't tell you how to live your life.

Hady:

I'll take it if it was.

Roy:

\[inaudible 00:07:54\].

Hady:

Thank you, that's helpful.

Roy:

We really appreciate you asking the question, it's a hard one. Most advice is like, someone's going to be like, "Well, I took off." I think that when you're age 32, you should take a year off. Who knows? \[inaudible 00:08:06\] not tomorrow because I'm taking the day off, but back next week and to be continued. And Hady I just feel that it's such a privilege for me to get to be here with you, with a former student and just kind of continue to track with you as your life unfolds. So thank you for giving me that opportunity.

Hady:

Likewise, thanks for having me. Bye.

**DAY 119**

**How do I keep track of what I need to do every day without getting bogged down?**

Minn:

We're back.

Roy:

Yay. It's time for another one of your questions about work. Just as a reminder, we are startup investors who focus on the future of work.

Minn:

Today is day 119. This week we're answering your questions about calendaring and time management, productivity. I think this is a really big topic, and so we're only going to be able to scratch the surface of it. But, for today, how do I keep track of what I'm supposed to do every day without feeling overwhelmed or bogged down?

Roy:

Yeah. We can only scratch the surface in a few days. If you keep asking questions that get us at a better way of looking at it, then we can go a lot further. This is so important because in a sense, if you're a professional, what you do is manage your time. I'd like to, at some point, get to a mental model of how to think about your time.

Roy:

Within that mental model, I'm confident that the single most important thing is figuring out the single most important thing, meaning knowing what it is you need to get done, selecting it. We can talk about that on another day, like how do I pick that thing?

Roy:

Let's assume for a second that you know what it is you need to do on a given day. You've got your short list of one to three things that are the absolute things that are your non-negotiables. Then you have the feeling, which many of us have, where day after day, you don't quite get to that thing and you wish you did and you kick yourself and you feel bad or you just kind of move on.

Roy:

I would just say, once you know that thing, then having the system that makes it easy, not requiring willpower, but easy, for you to do it first and get it done is the only thing that matters. I'll say, I went through a whole system on these. I used to write out a different to-do list for myself every day. I had these endless piles of composition notebooks. I tried to use software where every day I'd carry them over. And then eventually I got tired of regrouping, so I'd write them on post-its and move them from one day to the next.

Roy:

I'm one of these people that's constantly been experimenting with systems, and there wasn't great software for it. Now, you have tons of great software. What I would pause it, is that what works for me is a single source of truth for the things that must be done above all others, which I keep omnipresent physically for me. Digitally, but physically, is what I mean by that throughout the day.

Roy:

I use WorkFlowy, which happens to be a company we invested in, and in WorkFlowy, I have a bullet point that says "today," and under today I have the two or three things I need to do. Today on my list is responding to questions about one particular company we're considering investing in, buying a holiday gift, and doing some edits to documents that are team documents like notes to go out to our founders, that kind of thing.

Roy:

It just sits there all day long. I actually have it on another monitor over on the side, and throughout the day I try to come back and refer to it. Some days I worry that won't be enough. On those days what I do, and arguably what I should do all the time, is what the productivity gurus call "eating the frog," meaning doing the undesirable, but extremely important thing first and scheduling time for it. Like just literally having... Scheduling time means on your calendar, having a block of time that says, I will do whatever you call those items, your today items or something like that. I know when I get it done, I just feel a ton better.

Roy:

The bog down is just a matter of distraction, and so when you get distracted, how do you have something that forces it to come up? I mean, I really wish there were software that intermittently flashed it on my screen when it knew I was free and said, "Hey, now is the time to do it." If there is such a tool, somebody please let me know. For now, WorkFlowy works great, so that's how I do it. What do you think, Minn?

Minn:

I think that sense of experimentation is certainly one I think all the productivity wonky people love to do. Something at least that's worked for me pretty consistently is time boxing, like Pomodoro is kind of the well known technique of setting either a 20 or 30 minute time interval to say, "Oh, okay, I will only do this one thing for the next 25 minutes." For me, that's typically be in my inbox, where that seems to work best. If you force yourself to only focus, and actually when you do, it is shocking how productive you can be if you only say I'm only going to do this one thing. I won't switch over to a different tab. I'm turning off all my notifications. I'm not answering my text messages.

Minn:

I think, and then the keeping track of what to do is... I'm a little old school. I just do it like a text editor or just like a running list. And then for us as a team, I know that checking in with Range, which is also a portfolio company, but it kind of is your way of broadcasting to the team what are your priorities for the day.

Roy:

Yeah. Range is an essential part of my workflow on it, too, just as a sense of it's a commitment mechanism for me. I am looking between Range and WorkFlowy as a way of making sure I'm honest with myself. I don't use Range as my primary way of keeping track of it because I want to be able to edit that really flexibly throughout the day, and so Workflowy is kind of like my text editor. I think a text editor is a great solution for it, something that isn't standalone. Anyway, I think that works for me.

Minn:

Yeah. Candice, Range is a team success piece of software where you can kind of do asynchronous check-ins with your teammates about your priorities. If you go to range.co, shameless plug, try it out with your team.

Roy:

Before you invest in these things in part \[inaudible 00:06:00\], great for this. So if you find other stuff, that's awesome. We are investors and we will invest in said things if they meet our criteria. \[inaudible 00:06:09\]

Minn:

That's sound advice, not given. If you have other questions you want us to answer, we've got a couple exciting, fun guests this week to help answer some of our calendar deep questions, and so reply to us here.

Roy:

Yeah. To be continued.

Minn:

To be continued.

**DAY 120**

**How do I kill projects when everything feels important?**

\[Guest: _\*\*_[Jason Madhosingh](https://twitter.com/madho?lang=en)\]

Roy:

\[inaudible 00:00:00\] we ready to go live. Welcome back, time for another question about work. If you're new on Roy, I'm a startup investor in the Future of Work, and today's day 120, I think, is that right? Something like that. And I love having guests with whom I've had a chance to work before. And so Madho, I got to know working on a get out the vote project called Walk the Vote, and his day job, which I guess is what you were doing with us is being a fractional CMO for social impact organizations. And as a Future of Work productivity junkie myself, and this week, we're talking about calendars and how we manage time, I saw a fellow junkie, or I don't know about a junkie, but fellow expert, let's put it that way, in Madho. And so we'll ask and break down the following question today, which is when I am in a state of everything feeling important, how do I kill things? Madho, tell us.

Madho:

Thanks, Roy. I think when we first talked about this, the exact phrase was how do we kill projects when everything is on fire, which is probably more appropriate in 2020. I'm not great at this. It takes a lot of work and diligence and discipline to kind of constantly refine it. But I find that making a list of all things is actually the best starting point for this. So I like to take a deep breath, figure out number one, what are the most important things to me. Right. And I literally just write down the first three things that come to mind about what's important, because \[crosstalk 00:01:50\]

Roy:

I understand in that case you don't mean a list of all of the things that you are considering killing, you mean a list of your own inner priorities of importance, or what kinds of things go on that list?

Madho:

Yeah. That's exactly right. This is like your North Star. Like, I know at any given moment that the things that are important to me are my family, my health, and then work. And so that's an easy one, like a top three list. And look, this process works for me. You might need five. You probably don't need 25, but five is probably cool. And one is probably too few, but you know, I start by writing down that, and that is like the North Star of at all. And then we get into it. Then you write down everything that you think you're working on. And I say, you think you're working on it because you might think you're working on something and then realize through this process that actually you're not, and that's not a problem. That's actually a good thing. I think part of figuring out what it is that you're working also means clearing mental inventory and space, so that you're not going to get stressed.

Roy:

Yeah. I have to be honest. That is the part of the process where I often get stuck is that when everything is on fire, I am often so overwhelmed that figuring out how to get the clarity to even do this kind of exercise. This kind of exercise is the precise thing that I differ. And what I really appreciate about what you're saying, and I want to let you keep going, is that this is actually a pretty lightweight exercise. This is not like take 90 minutes to do a thorough examination. This is like as lightweight as you could imagine.

Madho:

Yeah, that's right. It's kind of more of like a gross sorting exercise than a \[inaudible 00:03:43\] sorting exercise. \[crosstalk 00:03:44\]

Roy:

Really great way to put it.

Madho:

Yeah. So I write down everything that I think I'm working on and then I basically make a line. And then on one side of the line is everything that fits into those top three things that I spoke about before, the North Star, and either falls in or doesn't. It's kind of like a really binary exercise. And if you think that something's on the margin, it doesn't fit, get rid of it. \[crosstalk 00:04:10\]

Roy:

When in doubt, cut it out.

Madho:

When in doubt, cut it out. And that's a huge step in and of itself. So now you need to look at all those things that aren't part of your priorities and figure out, there's basically, again, two piles. You've either started something or you haven't started something. And the same principle applies if you think you might have started something, but you're not sure. \[crosstalk 00:04:36\]

Roy:

Then you started it.

Madho:

You didn't start it. And that's okay. \[crosstalk 00:04:39\]

Roy:

Oh, you didn't? Meaning like I often trick myself into something and be like, "Oh, that's barely begun." But then I realized I've spun up other people on it or something like that. You're saying don't give yourself credit for doing things you have yet to do.

Madho:

That's correct. That's right. You should be your own strictest teacher on this, more than anything, and then you do the next two steps sorting exercise, which is looking at the things that you've started and figuring out which of those are commitments to other people. And that's important too, because even though something might not be in your top three doesn't mean that it's not in someone else's top three and that's your next sort of pile to sort through. And then once you've done that, you go into that pile of things that you've started and that are commitments to other people. And you have to ask yourself, "Does this project have meaningful value for that other person? Will it hurt them if you don't deliver on it?" And that needs to be in your consideration set too. Because we also serve other people and promise to serve other people and we needed to figure out what's the impact of letting something hit the floor. And it's okay if it does, but you need to know about it.

Roy:

Right. \[crosstalk 00:06:03\] You can be prepared to pay it, basically.

Madho:

Totally. Totally right. Right. And so now you've done enough work to get started. And so now you actually need to get a blank sheet of paper and say everything that you haven't started, doesn't have a meaningful outside commitment, won't hurt people if you don't deliver, just kill it. Write it on that sheet of paper and stick that sheet of paper in Gringotts, in your safe and come back to it. Yeah. It's a list of worthwhile projects. But not right now. They're just things that you can't do right now, but this is all the easy separating the wheat from the chaff.

Madho:

And I think the hardest part about this exercise is the part where you need to be really honest and open and vulnerable to your friends and your colleagues and people you may have made commitments to. And if something's on that list and someone else is attached to it, you have to ask, "How can I help you take this forward? Because I can't take it forward myself, or in the way that we originally discussed in a time or fashion that would make sense or at a level of fidelity that would make both of us satisfied. So let's call it what it is. And how do I help you?" \[crosstalk 00:07:33\]

Roy:

Having \[inaudible 00:07:34\] through that a few times, I think one of the most useful things here is like a lot of us know, yes, I should do that. And then you get stuck. And I had this conversation yesterday with the founders. Could you just helped me with the wording on that? Because figuring out exactly how you say it and in this document, you've linked here, which on social, we will also directly link to it. I just think that there is a real power to giving somebody, not what you should say, but what are the defaults because it makes it so much easier to just take it forward and actually come up with your own wording. So I really appreciate that.

Madho:

Yeah. And everyone's going to have their own template or model and this is, I think, a starting point. This works for me most of the time. It doesn't work all the time. It's a starting point. \[crosstalk 00:08:28\]

Roy:

One question. No, it's great. And I also appreciate that it's both practical and empathetic to the other person, which is as I've come to know you, characteristic of your style. When you do this exercise or when you do something like it and kill things, what are the kinds of things you often find yourself killing? Like for me, it's stuff the thing that I thought would be a really great idea for someone to do and it doesn't exist. And I thought, "Might as well be me." That's often the stuff that I want to kill. You and I were talking about like making pencils for artists. Like that I'll noodle with, but it's in Gringotts, which having watched Order of the Phoenix with my daughter last night is perfect timing. But oftentimes those are the ones for me. What are the kinds of things you find yourself killing?

Madho:

Yeah. Sometimes they're weird house projects that I realized through this process, only I wanted. I think that the biggest pile or category that I realize is the things that I really imagined could come to life, but didn't have buy-in anywhere else that naturally fall to that list because you didn't start it. And it's not a commitment to anyone else, and it's not in your priorities. And so that isn't to say that these aren't useful or valuable ideas. And I think if you apply this in a different way, if you apply this to a specific work or a core company, these might be great things for you to outsource. They might be things where if you think they provide value, but you can't put a body on it inside your organization, maybe you should outsource it.

Madho:

Maybe instead of building those walnut shelves myself, by cutting down a tree and dragging it out, maybe I should just go to Ikea and buy a shelf and have a task rabbit put it together. I think it becomes a good tool to triage, more than anything else. And the most important thing about this that I've realized is just because you made this list once doesn't mean you made it forever. Things, shuffle things change, and it's worthwhile I find to come back to this exercise, if not that list once in a while. \[crosstalk 00:11:00\]

Roy:

And I've also seen... Sorry, did I interrupt you?

Madho:

No, not at all.

Roy:

I've also seen that. And I keep talking to you all day. So let's bookmark this for future one. We'll do more conversations in a future one. I've also seen for myself, what ends up happening as you do this exercise more than muscle gets stronger and you stop taking on things. You start saying no earlier in the process to save yourself from the pain, or I will kill this unless I have this kind of validation of working with somebody else. And then you front-load that risk earlier in the process. So you kind of develop this muscle memory that goes around it. And I think that could be really powerful too. It's not just about the exercise itself.

Madho:

I think that's dead on. The Roy stage gate process feels like it's a HBR PDF coming to you

Roy:

There we go. There we go. Well, thank you Madho for joining us on This is Not Advice, it is not advice you gave. And just as a reminder for folks, the reason it's not advice is because Madho and I don't know how you should live your life. We only know how we should live ours. And most advice is people telling you how to do what they want in their lives. And Min and I will be back tomorrow. If you have a question you want us to tackle, almost every question comes from something we've been asked, so just hit us up on the socials or otherwise. And if you want to find Madho, add that link here in the video, you will find his contact information. If you're fortunate enough to get to work with him, good on you. And Madho, to be continued.

Madho:

Thanks. Please do something nice for someone today. Everyone.

Roy:

Love it.

**DAY 121**

**How do I protect uninterrupted, deep work time in my calendar when there are so many meetings to attend?**

\[Guest: [Hunter Walk](https://twitter.com/hunterwalk), Homebrew\]

Roy:

Okay. It is time for another question about work. And if you're new, I'm Roy, and Minn and I are both startup investors in the Future Of Work. And Hunter, our guest, our very special guest for our last This is Not Advice of 2020, because tomorrow I will turn off and protect some uninterrupted time, which we'll talk about, is today. What day is it, Minn? Are we 120? What are we today?

Minn:

Today is 121. And for those of you who may not yet know about Hunter, you can find him at Twitter @hunterwalk. He is an investor, founder, right? Co-founder of Homebrew. And we feel really lucky to have gotten to invest and co-invest in some awesome companies together.

Roy:

And I just want to say, one of the people whose path through tech, I took many lessons from along the way. And Hunter and I have talked about this from Second Life, one of the more inspirational companies in terms of how it did its own future of work practices within the company and took lots of lessons from it to driving product and other areas at YouTube. And now getting to ... I think we made the transition to being investors at the same time.

Hunter Walk:

We did, we did.

Roy:

All right, Minn, sorry. Question and Hunter's take on it. I'll shut up.

Minn:

No, no problem. So today, everyone's starting to prepare for the holidays and think about 2021. And Hunter, you had this blog post, which we'll share later, about killing all your meetings and resetting your calendar for 2021. And so we thought for today, we could ask you the question, how do I protect my uninterrupted time when it feels like a lot of my meetings, they're probably going to be super important?

Hunter Walk:

Well, thanks for having me on, especially the holiday \[inaudible 00:01:50\] I understand that a lot of people might consider themselves to be scheduled takers versus schedule makers, right? So, everybody has some degree of agency, control, over their calendars when they do things. Other people have meetings dropped on them and maybe can't always move them around.

Hunter Walk:

But I think the idea of believing your time is very important and that at any moment, your calendar is probably not optimized for the type of work you need to get done, a range of collaborative work with people, but also periods of deep work where you can have alone time to concentrate, to be creative, to work on things that don't really fit in 15 to 20 to 30 minutes slots you have between one-on-ones or team check-ins or things like that.

Hunter Walk:

So, yeah, I'm a believer that if you can, start with a blank slate and rebuild. Because what you'll find is that, by the end of the year, your calendar probably looks like an old man's teeth, right? Lots of holes. Some that are healthy, some aren't. So, I want you to have a beautiful, fresh set of teeth by the beginning of the year. Meetings that matter, large stretches of time to get work done. And we can talk a little bit about how do you get there, for example.

Roy:

Yeah. So, in budgeting, this was once called the zero based budgeting practice. Clear it all out instead of starting with the default of what you spent on the year before. I'm just curious, when you think about what you add in, when you're making your savvy choices about what healthy teeth look like, what are some of the things you're proud to add in? And what are some of the things that you struggle with? What are some examples of things where the rubber hits the road on actual decisions or the teeth hit each other on actual-

Hunter Walk:

Yeah. So, I think there's always two types of refactoring that I end up working on. One is reoccurring meetings. So, by the end of a year, I've had a number of reoccurring meetings, some internal, some with the founders we back. Because they get added, changed incrementally throughout the year, they're usually scattershot across the day. Some of them are weekly when they don't need to be, some are hour long and you have enough track record to now see that maybe they should be 45 minutes or 30 minutes.

Hunter Walk:

On the flip side, sometimes you have that meeting that's only been scheduled for half an hour and also always runs 10 minutes late. And so it's time to either reconcile whether or not you could get that work done in 30 minutes, or maybe you should hold aside actually 45. So, I look at those and I just set it up in a spreadsheet, and it's who's it with, how often is it happening, how long is the duration? And I'll start to tweak, like, "Okay, if I have full control over this, what would I do?"

Hunter Walk:

Then I would try to set up some bounding boxes on my calendar where I can group those together. So do some of those things back to back. So I don't have to have these half hour, 45 minute breaks in between a bunch of one-on-ones that aren't really good for much, besides working out at the top of your inbox, which is fake productivity anyway.

Hunter Walk:

The second type is setting up stretches where you're trying to do no meetings, right? I think everybody has done some variation of this. They've tried to draw a bounding box on their calendar. It says, "No meetings." Or things like that. And what'll happen is they get scheduled over or you start ...

Minn:

Right, you start being more protective of it.

Hunter Walk:

So, I have two tricks there.

Roy:

Yes, please. This is good. Now we're getting now we're getting to the \[crosstalk 00:05:20\]

Hunter Walk:

One is make up imaginary friends. Put, "Meeting with so-and-so." People are much less likely to schedule over your whole time if they think it's another meeting. So, the difference between just, "DNB, do not book," versus, "Hold for work," versus, "Meeting with Roy," where Roy is not the wonderful person he is, but my fake friend.

Roy:

\[crosstalk 00:05:47\] Meeting with Roy and on my own things, because so often you get those ghosts items where somebody else sends you something and there things says, "Meeting with Hunter because that's what it is in their calender."

Hunter Walk:

I'm very good at etiquette. I always put my name first it's like, "Hunter-

Roy:

\[crosstalk 00:06:02\] Use the error to our advantage. Put in the calendar, "Meeting with Hunter." It's true.

Hunter Walk:

I don't recommend a standing meeting that says, "Funeral." That's kind of a little dark. But if you need four hours one day and instead of putting do not book, just put, "Funeral" or something like that. Nobody will schedule over it.

Roy:

Does that mean your own? So, actually you were going to get to another trick. Because to me the biggest problem is not other people not other people not respecting my own boundaries, it's me not respecting my own boundaries.

Hunter Walk:

Yes. I violate my own boundaries all the time. And then we have to have a conversation.

Roy:

Well, how does that work?

Hunter Walk:

So, what I try to do there ... I now have enough self-awareness to understand what times of day I am most likely to have good focus or attention, and it's not arbitrary. It's basically I'm good in mornings. I'm good in mornings. So, what I try to do is put those times in the morning, make sure that my EA isn't scheduling meetings, let's say, before 10, unless I need them. And then boxing off that time. I'm working off a list of my "to do's" that I've also put 30, 30, 60, 60 plus against.

Hunter Walk:

And so I'm sort of saying, "Okay, I have two hours, I'm picking two 60 minute tasks." So, I'm going into those not with some notion of, "Oh, I have two hours of deep work. What do I want to do?" But I'm looking at it as a puzzle where I have my puzzle pieces and then I'm assigning myself. Sometimes I'll even do those as bounding boxes on the calendar, within my two hour block where I'm like, "Oh, this is 30 minutes for resume screening. This is 30 minutes for ..."

Hunter Walk:

So, I'm scheduling the time. The more transitions I have, the more that there's a, "Oh, I just finished this, but I have an hour left in my deep work time, but I don't know what I'm going to do yet." The more likely I am to bail, I'm going to go open up a browser window. I'm going to start walking around. So, if I can set it aside at a time when I know I'm going to be productive, and then pre-build my deep work puzzle, I stick with it more than if it's later in the day or I haven't yet pre-thought what I'm going to use that time for

Roy:

I love the idea and I had never considered it before, which feels stupid, I feel like now I'm just getting smarter, of taking my deep work items and just adding a time estimate to that. Because otherwise it's like what order and lose importance. I think that's really smart.

Hunter Walk:

Sometimes I get myself a little treat too. I mean, look, we're all adults, but like a cookie midway through your deep work period, sometimes you deserve it.

Minn:

Yeah.

Roy:

We are going to give our listeners the cookie of reflecting on the not advice that they have just been given. And I think that we could go really deep on this. I would love ... Hunter, I think that your productivity junkiness is something that I'd just love to mine more and talk more about. Minn, anything else you want to share before wrap?

Minn:

No, I didn't think we would ever be talking about teeth on an episode of This is Not Advice. And so, a little shout out to Bowery.

Hunter Walk:

Always happy to promote a portfolio company.

Minn:

I'll drop a link \[inaudible 00:09:08\] Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Roy.

Roy:

I was just thanking Hunter.

Minn:

Aw.

Roy:

\[inaudible 00:09:14\] Always an awkward treat when people we know really well, we get to come and do this with for a second. Because it's just such a different context and I'm just grateful that you are a person who is always up for it.

Hunter Walk:

I am grateful that all of you exist. I enjoy collaborating even for short bits of time where I suggest lying about funerals as a productivity hack. And I hope everybody has a wonderful last few weeks of the year.

Minn:

We'll see you for This is Not Advice in the new year, everyone.

Roy:

See you in the new year. To be continued.

Hunter Walk:

Bye.

**DAY 122**

**Should I leave my job to focus on the job search?**

Minn Kim:

Yay, and we are back. The first episode of \#thisisnotadvice, Day 121. This is the first episode of 2021.

Roy Bahat:

I know. For those of you that are new, we do one question about work every day, and Minn and I are startup investors in the future of work. And the reason we call this \#thisisnotadvice is because in our experience, advice is somebody else telling you how you should live your life. But really, what they're talking about is how they want to live their life. And your life is yours, so we're going to give you our perspective based on what we do, and then you're going to decide for yourself. What's our question today, Minn?

Minn Kim:

Well, this week we wanted to tackle a bunch of questions that I think we got over the course of the last couple of weeks, about finding a new job, growing in a job that you might already have, or transitioning in a role that the company that you might be at. And so today's is, do I need a resume if I'm job hunting and if not, what's the better alternative?

Roy Bahat:

Yeah. This is one of these areas where, man, did I blow a lot of expertise in life, because it used to be that the answer was almost always, yes. At least for, call it information industry jobs, I'm not talking about if you wanted to be a tradesperson, or something like that, I don't know those industries that as well. It was standard. And man, I learned how to format it carefully, and tell the story through a resume and... And now the answer is, it entirely depends on the context in which you are job searching.

Roy Bahat:

And so if I now get an email out of the blue, it's somebody saying, "Oh, and attached is my resume," it's actually a bit of a negative signal. In the world of startups and tech, you have enough of a public biography that, whether you're on LinkedIn, which is probably the default, or somewhere else, a thing that you say in public, which I therefore know has been exposed to the sunlight of transparency, and therefore is more likely to be true, and consistently presented. And where, by the way, I know how to read a LinkedIn because I'm so familiar with them, is so much more valuable to me than having a two to three page PDF.

Roy Bahat:

Let alone, by the way, do not use anything other than a PDF if you're going to send a resume in that way, because that's the only way you control the formatting. And then, in other contexts, for example, a lot of folks who I know are now talking to the Biden administration about some role working with them or another. There is a step in that process for many of those roles, which is sort of the formal submission of a resume. And where they may perceive it, I don't know in that context, but in some contexts, they perceive it to be downmarket to be relying on your LinkedIn because that's just still this website that's out there, that some people use and some don't. In the financial services industry, use of LinkedIn is still pretty inconsistent.

Roy Bahat:

The answer went from, "Absolutely, you must," to, "maybe not and it might hurt you." Now, if I were going to do a job search, would I still prepare a resume? Yeah, I still probably would because going through the exercise of putting it together, and thinking about what do I want to emphasize, and what order and all that, still really valuable. That's how I think about it. But \[inaudible 00:03:08\] more recently, I think, than I have, since I've been sitting here for eight years at Bloomberg Beta, so I'm on the receiving end. I'm curious how that lines up with what you think.

Minn Kim:

Well, we'll talk about a little bit of that later this week, about what to do if you've been at the same organization for a long time. But in terms of resume, it definitely depends on your industry. There are some standards that you can't get around. Obviously, if you're applying to a big company, they'll ask you for your resume. I think the thing that might be different is, it's like a yes and, and so if you are going through the recruiting process, and you make it through the screening or something like that, assume that they will Google you, right? And so if you have other digital breadcrumbs about who you are, whether it is a social media that you use, or a personal website, or blog posts that you've written, or something like that, I think that all contributes to what is now the modern resume of, who are you as a person? And do we want you to represent our organization?

Roy Bahat:

Yeah. And I'd just say, in addition to the industry, and if you don't know, you have to either ask somebody, or make your best guess, or observe what others do, it also has to do with the nature of the role. Because sometimes for very senior roles, I mean, I get cold emails all the time of like, "I am looking for a role as a chief something officer at a big startup." Sometimes, if you're sending me your resume, it's all I need to know, it's already a step in the wrong direction.

Minn Kim:

Totally. Okay, so this is a meaty topic and we'll have more questions about it, but if I could leave everyone with one tactical advice, buy your domain, your name domain.

Roy Bahat:

Yes. Good one. Or some variation of it because...

Minn Kim:

Or gift it to someone.

Roy Bahat:

Joe Smith not be available. Fortunately, Roy Bahat was.

Minn Kim:

Yeah, and so that's one.

Roy Bahat:

\[inaudible 00:04:58\] the next Roy Bahat, so watch out, kid.

Minn Kim:

Okay, well that is all for today. If you have another question about work that you want us to answer, drop them in the comments below. You can find us on Twitter and LinkedIn, and all sorts of places. And that was today's Not Advice.

Roy Bahat:

To be continued. Thank you, Minn.

Minn Kim:

Thank you.

**+++**

**DAY 123**

**Do I need a resume? What is a better alternative?**

Minn:

Take two 2021 on This Is Not Advice. We are on Day 122. Yeah.

Roy:

And it's time for another one of your questions about work. Minn and I are startup investors who focus on the future of work. And we do one of your questions every day.

Minn:

And this week we are answering a bunch of questions about finding, changing, growing in jobs and career paths. And so, today we're going to break down this following question: should I leave my job to focus on the job hunt?

Roy:

At first, no.

Roy:

Leaving your job as a one-way door, right? If you leave you can't decide a month later, "Oh, that didn't actually help that much in the job search."

Roy:

Then you can't come back.

Roy:

And I'm setting aside some obvious things that like, you may not be able to leave your job. You may need the income, in which case searching while you're sitting at your job.

Roy:

So, I think the question is, if you can leave your job, if you're in a position to be able to, how much does it help to in your search?

Roy:

And first, I think it can hurt in some ways. And one way it can hurt is that you have to explain why you...

Roy:

And Motto, I see what you're saying there. We're going to get to this in a second. I love when people take the other side.

Roy:

I think you may need to explain why you've left. Sometimes being in your job gives you something to talk about in the interviews.

Roy:

And searching for a job is often an unpredictable process. It's not like if you put a month in or something like that, then you will definitely have a better result. Sometimes you're waiting for people. And so doing it part time can be helpful because well, the person might take three weeks and blah, blah, blah.

Roy:

The ways in which it helps, and this is, as we often say, a timing and dosage question, because you may need more time to do things. If you're a parent with kids finding time outside of work hours to edit your resume \(we talked about resumes yesterday\), polish up your LinkedIn, let's put it that way, can be challenging.

Roy:

And so more time to be helpful.

Roy:

And then, Motto, Jason \[Mottosin 00:02:13\], points out, "Find yourself."

Roy:

And I think that if you're in a position to, if you're in the kind of search where you are thinking about making a more radical change, where you're considering really different options for what you might do, then sometimes having time to reflect and think is a really magnificent thing and a real privilege.

Roy:

And I'd actually say that, whether you're searching for a new job or not, having that time to reflect and think can be amazing.

Roy:

And I've gone through phases where I've left a job by choice. I've gone through phases where I left a job because the plank ran out and I had to jump off. And they've all been different in different ways.

Roy:

So, this is not one where there is an obvious answer other than to start in the seat before you go through a one-way door.

Roy:

And thank you, Joe Daniels, who has made some transitions himself. And we got to get you on the show at some point, Joe.

Roy:

Minn, thoughts?

Minn:

Yeah, I think the timing and dosage one resonates.

Minn:

I mean, this is one where I think the answer is very much, it depends. And I think one way I might think about it is, the earlier you are in your career, you might still find yourself exploring different opportunities.

Minn:

And so, maybe a good litmus test is like the more nebulous of what you want to do next it is, maybe you should default to no and spend more time doing the research and talking to different individuals and across industries. And the more specific you get around, this is the role that I want, these are the kinds of companies, these are the kinds of people I want to work around, the more that becomes crystallized that it feels more of like, oh, okay. Then I can now actually spend some time bound amount of time to actually look for my next opportunity.

Roy:

Yeah. I love when we say it's timing and dosage saying on what factors does it depend should be a requirement for us.

Roy:

And it does raise for me that not all searches are for a new job, meaning sometimes what you're doing is you're trying to find an opportunity to collaborate with people on a start-up. And you can do that while on the job, but you may have conflicts.

Roy:

Sometimes you want to try before you buy. You want to do a thing where you work on a project with a company before you join them. And that's the kind of thing that you may not be able to do while still employed.

Roy:

And so, it depends on the nature of how you begin working in something. Corporate jobs or different thing where you might to get hired and have a first day and dot dot dot.

Minn:

Yeah. And Roy, you and I spend a lot of time...

Minn:

I mean, this is squarely in the future of work realm. And I feel like, increasingly we are seeing more individuals taking that try before you buy. I mean, side projects, that's a topic for a whole other day.

Minn:

But taking on ad hoc work to work on some project that might be in a new domain that you care about, that you're interested in and it might want to pursue a full-time opportunity in or whatever future opportunity? I think we're seeing that more. And on the flip side, employers also being open to candidates doing things like that.

Minn:

And so that is another topic for a future episode.

Roy:

Yeah. It also depends on what your host company thinks.

Roy:

To be continued. And yes, we've got hecklers today, but loving hecklers. So, thank you guys, and see you in the LinkedIn comments chiming in.

Minn:

Okay. Well, that's all for now.

Minn:

If you have other questions about work, start-ups, or anything like that, you can find Roy and me down below or anywhere that you've seen this. And we'll be back tomorrow.

Roy:

To be continued.

Minn:

To be continued.

**+++**

**DAY 124**

**How long is "too" long to stay in a job or at one company?**

Roy Bahat:

Time for another one of your questions about work. Minn and I are startup investors in the future of work, and we do one of your questions every day.

Minn Kim:

Today is day 124 if you've been following along. I think we might've had 2 day 121s, and so we're fast-forwarding into the future.

Roy Bahat:

We can bend time. Actually, Minn can bend time. \[inaudible 00:00:19\] time bending.

Minn Kim:

This week we've been answering questions about finding, growing, transitioning in jobs. Today's question is, how long is too long to stay in a job, or at a particular company?

Roy Bahat:

Yeah, I think, first of all, this is a privilege problem, because many people would love to be able to stay in a stable job. But assuming you have this problem, then the question is, are you learning? If you are still learning, the role can be great for you if you're learning fast enough to satisfy you. One of the things I struggled with as a CEO is there are plenty of people who are very happy to just keep doing the same thing forever, and not particularly improve at it, and just keep doing it. If that's you and your content, great. But if what you want is to develop and improve then make sure you're developing and improving rapidly, and what is that tied to? It's often tied to how fast the company is growing. Companies that are not evolving themselves oftentimes have less opportunity to grow, because the company itself, in some ways, is not learning and growing.

Roy Bahat:

Then the only other thing I'd say is that it can also be too long when you think about the following test. If I lost this job, would I be screwed? Would I just be stranded? And in particularly with companies that have extremely unusual cultures where you couldn't succeed anywhere else, where you just really learned the physics on planet your company, then you've got to think about, man, nothing's forever in life, and you just need to make sure that you would be okay. Watch your backside on that kind of stuff. But otherwise, I know people in Silicon Valley love to job hop. I don't think it's a bad sign if you've been at the best place for you for a very long time. I know tons of people who have had magnificent careers in professional services firms, and corporations, and their own businesses that they've created, by the way, as a founder. You're a founder who keeps learning, stay at the job forever if you want.

Minn Kim:

\[inaudible 00:00:02:23\].

Roy Bahat:

To me, it's about pace of learning.

Minn Kim:

Yeah. I think it's also a reflection of where is the company in terms of stage. Right? Can you grow with the company, because obviously, Roy, you and I are in the Silicon Valley tech industry, but... Where there are lots of very early stage companies, and it's a matter of how quickly is the organization growing relative to how quickly you want to grow, and you feel like you can grow.

Roy Bahat:

That's right.

Minn Kim:

... versus an established organization. There are lots of different horizontal paths that you can often take within \[crosstalk 00:02:55\].

Roy Bahat:

Yeah, and it's not necessarily true that smaller things grow faster. Plenty of small things go nowhere, plenty of big companies can grow really fast. I remember when I was a CEO, at some point I decided to leave in part, because there wasn't anything else I could take the company forward to do. I had run to the end of what I knew how to do with the company, and therefore I wasn't going to learn anything, so made sure my team was okay, and then skedaddled.

Minn Kim:

Yeah. Well, I don't know, there's a corollary to this question I think. That is how... I think you were talking about this earlier, about how short... Or can I stay at a job or role without it being auspicious either, to look like you're a constant job hopper or being perceived as-

Roy Bahat:

Yes.

Minn Kim:

... not investing in a role. We can tackle that question another day.

Roy Bahat:

In deed.

Minn Kim:

Well, that is the not advice for today. If you have other questions that you want us to answer about the future of work, about career, or anything like that, drop us a note down below wherever you're seeing this, and we'll do-

Roy Bahat:

Yeah.

Minn Kim:

... that tomorrow.

Roy Bahat:

Yeah. Again, we call this not advice, because when people are giving you advice, they're usually telling you how to live their life, or build their business, and we want you to live your own, so we'll just share what we're learning. Tomorrow we'll do that with a special guest. A founder of a company that we've invested in. To be continued.

Minn Kim:

To be continued.

Roy Bahat:

Thank you, Minn.

**DAY 125**

**As the technical co-founder, what changes can I expect to navigate as we hire other product and eng execs?**

\[Guest: [Gordon Wintrob](https://twitter.com/gwintrob?lang=en), Co-founder & CTO, Newfront Insurance\]

Roy:

Time now for another one of your questions about work. And if you're new, I'm Roy. I'm a startup investor in \[The Future Work 00:00:06\]. Today is day what? 125, I think. \[crosstalk 00:00:10\]

Minn:

Right? 125, 125.

Roy:

We love having guests, especially when they're founders in whom we've invested. And Gordon Wintrob is the co-founder and CTO of Newfront, which if you don't know, it probably means you are not a business that has bought insurance recently because they are a new and modern kind of insurance brokerage. And Gordon's going to help us with our theme of the week, which is all about kind of career transitions and how jobs evolve.

Minn:

Yeah. And so, I mean, Gordon, you're a co-founder of the company, you are the CTO. And one of the things I think would be really interesting to hear from you is this question around if, I'm the technical co-founder and as my company starts to grow, what can I expect in terms of my role and responsibilities shifting over time?

Gordon Wintrob:

Sure thing. Yeah, first of all, Roy and Minn, thanks so much for hosting this, it's awesome that you've been keeping it up so long and I'm honored to be here. And I also want to say for anyone listening that Bloomberg Beta has been an incredible partner from the very beginning. They are just awesome as investors, and if you're considering taking an investment from them, you should just shut up and take the money.

Minn:

\[crosstalk 00:01:21\] Compliment.

Roy:

Well, we gave him money, he gave us equities.

Gordon Wintrob:

Yeah, I think this is a good topic, because I think that there are not a lot of resources or not a lot of content out there to help in particular technical co-founders on the startup journey. I think there's kind of this vision of the technical co-founder who's hacking away in the garage, who just kind of does that until the company goes public, and doesn't really talk to anyone. And I think the reality is that that's not how it works.

Gordon Wintrob:

For me, it's very much a personal story. With my previous company, actually, we went through YC back in 2014 and we made every mistake out there. It was two friends from MIT, we both just figured, hey, let's write a lot of code. I don't really want to talk to customers. I'll go in YC for the dinners once a week. And it was a total failure mode there in the beginning. And so I think that going through YC was a good way to kind of force us to, hey, you need to talk to customers, you need to show week over week growth. You need to really think about the business model.

Gordon Wintrob:

And we were very lucky that we ended up getting acquired by LinkedIn. And that was kind of a nice bow on that experience. With Newfront, it's definitely been interesting kind of going from IC, doing hands-on engineering work in the beginning, to managing, to now kind of being a full-time founder.

Gordon Wintrob:

You know, I think one good example is actually early on...I'm trying to think about how to make this useful advice for other technical co-founders. And I think there was one moment that was a really good reminder of, hey, you're doing too much hands-on work. And it was early on. So Newfront, we're building the modern insurance brokerage and our software is really built to empower and supercharge brokers. And so we had brokers who joined our team and we had no way to kind of show them any sort of reporting or metrics. And one of my jobs once a week was to basically write a script that would pull some data out of a Postgres database and generate a CSV that would go to them. And it was something that I was doing every week, it was becoming more and more annoying as more brokers joined the team. And so eventually I built a broker dashboard where they could just log in and see a list of all of their clients.

Gordon Wintrob:

And this was something that it worked for about 10 minutes and then it fell over because the way I built it was really crappy, kind of just like pulled in all the data and didn't last very long. And so I remember when I was in that mode of like, oh, I should be the person building this thing because I'm the technical co-founder. It was like, no, no, no, no. Stop spending time on this, go focus on finding more great engineers who can take things and run with it. And that was sort of the the transition from hands-on IC, to being a manager.

Roy:

How did you, I'm just curious, cause like what I'm hearing is you're saying no one path up the mountain, you might find yourself riding up a managerial curve, or you might find yourself doing that for a while, and then transitioning into setting the technical vision and architecture, playing a, many founders play this role, of sort of call it like 'cultural center' of the company. And I've seen all different versions of it be successful, like literally every single one. And so how do you find yourself? When it was time to make those choices of, oh, I might need to evolve in the following way, how did you figure it out? Did you turn to somebody asking the \[comments about a book 00:00:05:11\] or were there people you asked, how in practice did you make those decisions?

Gordon Wintrob:

Some of it was just sort of gut feel based on kind of what I was feeling at the company. I definitely have other friends who are founders who are a little bit further ahead in the journey who, it's those people that you can text late at night, who would sort of give you a helpful nudge.

Roy:

\[crosstalk 00:05:39\] One click ahead. Sometimes two. It's finding mentors or sounding boards who are the right distance in front of you. Not like the CTO of some huge public tech corporation, but just a couple of clicks ahead.

Gordon Wintrob:

Exactly. I think those people are so key. I mean, for me, big mentors and friends have been all of the founders at Segment. I lived with them for a while and Calvin, the CTO there, it's been awesome to kind of learn from some of the mistakes that they've made. And I think they're a great example of having a great technical co-founder who also had to make that transition out of being hands-on to passing it over to, they have a great engineering leader named Tito who essentially handles that whole org.

Roy:

Yeah. I mean, I'd just say, I know you guys have, I think your head of growth is a Segment alum. We were just talking before we hit live, on being some of the few people remaining committed to San Francisco. It sometimes feels, and those little networks of living with somebody who did a thing, that has felt like some of the magic of having those relationships with people who can share knowledge and wisdom. So thank you for that.

Gordon Wintrob:

100%.

Roy:

Yeah.

Minn:

Well, thank you so much Gordon, for joining us today on This Is Not Advice. And so actually we'll be back and hopefully we'll have you back on another time to answer more questions, but in the meantime...

Roy:

Yeah. I mean the -

Gordon Wintrob:

Thanks so much.

Roy:

Yeah, it's just great to hear your perspective and just, I think in this case, it's particularly good because usually we say it's not advice because you're not telling somebody else how to live their life. You want them to make their own choices. In this case, what you really made clear is, there is no one best path on how this evolves. There are many, many ways, and you just solved for what you believed in your judgment was the best thing for the business at any given time.

Roy:

Somebody had asked about a book and I just want to say one thing before we wrap, which is, a book I found useful on these questions is 'Creativity, Inc.', which is Ed Catmull, who was a computer science professor before being the technical person at Pixar. And the reason I find the book so useful is that there is no one principle in the book. It is more like at any given moment when things come up, he thinks through, well, what should I be doing now? And it's not so much about the early stage journey. That's more about how they did Pixar over the long arc, but this is a train and the solutions as they come up are really buried. So thank you for giving us that reality. Gordon.

Gordon Wintrob:

Can I also plug one book that's actually been helpful for more of the technical side? It's a book named, I think it's called The Manager's Path and it's by someone named Camille. She was the engineering leader at Rent the Runway.

Roy:

Awesome.

Gordon Wintrob:

And that is a phenomenal book. It really takes you from being a hands-on IC, to being a tech lead, to being manager, director, all the way throughout the whole chain. \[crosstalk 00:08:42\]

Roy:

Yeah. Let's link to that. We'll link to that when we post on social for this. All right everybody, we will be back on Monday, and next week we're going to talk about one of my favorite topics, which is how you get things done, AKA productivity, something that I've obsessed over for a very long time, and now arguably is central to my occupation as investing in \[The Future Work 00:09:02\]. So leave us any questions you want to us to tackle in the comments and on Twitter or wherever, we are find-able on the internet. Thank you, Gordon, and to be continued.

Gordon Wintrob:

\[crosstalk 00:09:14\] Thanks man. Bye.

**DAY 126**

**What is my greatest productivity hack to get things done?**

\[Guest: [James Currier](https://twitter.com/JamesCurrier), General Partner, NFX\]

Roy:

... after celebrating or experiencing, I'm not quite sure if celebrating is quite the right word. Want to celebrate Martin Luther King, but experiencing these days feels like a more all-inclusive term. We're back for another question about work. And if you're new, I'm Roy and I'm a startup investor on the Future Work along with Minn, who's here with me. Today is our 126th day of doing these and we love having guests, especially guests with whom we get to collaborate frequently. James Currier started and is a partner of NFX, which I think of as a venture firm that was an instant classic, the moment it arrived it felt like it had been needed and there forever, and we love working with NFX. And James is somebody who has produced a lot with a tremendous sense of, to me at least, of calm and sanity around it. So we're going to talk a little bit about that. And don't overreact James. I see you like, you get on well with the compliment. Go ahead, Minn, what's our question today?

Minn:

So we were going to ask this week about productivity and how to get things done. And so we figured James, you spend, you're investing and writing and supporting founders. You've got a lot on your plate. And so what are some of your greatest productivity hacks?

James Currier:

Yeah, the way I think about it, I don't spend a lot of time reading the productivity hack newsletters and whatnot. For me, the big rock in all this is deciding who to work with, because they're the ones who tell you whether you were enjoying your time or not. If you have someone in your life that lights you up and you get to work with them every day, it's almost like who cares how productive you are. As long as you're spending time with people like a Pete Flynn or a Giggy Levy, or my partner, Morgan Bella. These people light me up. And so that gets around the issue of productivity. But when they let you up and they're incredibly smart, then you just tend to get a lot more done, you get more energy. You do things more quickly. You can make decisions more quickly. There's a trust. There's a flow. There's not so much debate. There's no politics being played. There's nothing to slow you down. There's so much less friction.

Roy:

I'm curious how you know, you have partners now. And when you partner with somebody in a venture capital firm, it's like co-founding a company where you're likely bonded at the hip with them for quite a long period of time. And not all of those people did you work with in a full-time capacity before you started working on at NFX? So what are the signals... Forget about somebody on your team. When you're collaborating with somebody else, what are the cues you're looking for in terms of what you experienced that tell you you're on the right track with somebody?

James Currier:

The first thing is how you feel in your stomach when they come in the room, right?

Roy:

I love that.

James Currier:

Do you light up or are you worried or are you feeling sick? And there's a lot of firms that unfortunately have built their management teams by figuring out who's going to make the most money for the fund. And at NFX, we think who lights us up and who's going to be a great investor, because want to build for 20, 30 years and you just can't sustain it unless you really like the people.

Roy:

And any clues. Now I'll just ask the other way, any clues when you've had somebody who was on a team of yours who wasn't quite right, that showed up in how productive you were, things you found yourself doing with your time, where you thought maybe I just don't like this or want to be doing it. Anything beyond the gut feel?

James Currier:

Yeah, you want the meeting to not start. You want the meeting to end when that person isn't the right person. You worry about the communication because you're worried they're going to get defensive or they don't trust you. everything has to be written down. That's a sign that things aren't going well. You have to prepare and prepare and prepare people for the meeting and then have the meeting and then do a... It's just heavy lifting. So it makes you unproductive in everything you do when you have the wrong person.

Roy:

Yeah, I think one of the joys of being at a small firm as opposed to a large company can be that you have some choice over it. And in a large company, you've got to navigate your way through and you're inevitably going to have some people with whom you have the match and some people with whom you don't have the match, but I love that in your gut way of thinking about it. We just had as a team our once a quarter get together for a few days on a call. We never wanted to call it an offsite, because that's just defined by where it is. But especially not now, we're all sitting in literally the same chairs. And I just always think about how whenever that meeting starts, I'm excited for it.

James Currier:

And look, I think if you are a CEO or running a smaller firm, a smaller company, you need to get rid of the people who don't light you up and don't light other people up, because you're responsible for that environment for them in that context. And if you have certain nodes in your network which are diminishing the energy and the enthusiasm and the trust, that's diminishing the productivity of your whole organization. And it's giving people lives that they don't enjoy as much. And so you as a leader have a responsibility to clean that out and keep that fresh and to have the channels of communication open with the people-

Roy:

You know, there was this New York Times article, which may be, if I can find it I'll link to it. And it was pretty provocative at the time because it was, if I remember right, around the time when the economy was struggling and my firm was considering when I was running a company, doing a layoff. And it said, if you want a happy company, fire the unhappy people. And I don't want to say that that is unambiguously true, but there's definitely some truth in it.

James Currier:

Yeah, no, there's something in there, some kernel in there. You have to be a steward of the environment for yourself and for the people around you, and then the productivity will rise up. And then you can add in productivity hacks, like drinking tea before 7:00 AM and all this stuff. But that's a lot of, I think shamanism more than it is \[crosstalk 00:05:48\].

Roy:

I love that. No more shamanism. I do not have a morning ritual.

James Currier:

That's not at the heart of what makes things... So working with the right people and then working on the right things and clearing out the things and having the right people to help you figure out what those right things are.

Roy:

Minn, anything you want to add?

Minn:

No, I was just reminded, we were talking to one of the founders in our portfolio and how especially during the last year, they would give periodic Wednesdays off I think it was, and it was a deep work Wednesday where no meetings were expected. And instead they found that a lot of people used the time to do self professional development, whether it was taking a course or writing or reading something in depth and commenting on it. And so it just reminds me of that, when you create that environment, people don't want to just go off and do whatever they want. \[crosstalk 00:06:34\] time doing something that's professionally and personally enriching.

James Currier:

Makes sense. And it reminds me that the most popular class at the GSB is the touchy feely class. And the most popular class at HBS is lead, which is basically the same thing, which is your interpersonal, personal development type stuff.

Roy:

For anybody who's watching very carefully, the creator of touchy feely is going to be talking with some founders we know about her new book, which is called Connect. And so James, if you or any of your folks want to join us for that, let us know.

James Currier:

Absolutely.

Minn:

We should have Carol come on and fill in one day.

Roy:

That's a great idea. Ohm yeah. We'll have Carol come on, Carol \[Rober 00:07:13\] .

James Currier:

She's dynamite, yeah.

Roy:

She's a legend.

Minn:

Well, thank you so much, James. This is a pleasure. Hopefully we'll get to have you back on one day. We're talking all about product personal productivity and how to get things done. And so Roy and I will be back tomorrow. If you have other questions that you want us to answer, drop them down below wherever you see this. And thanks again, James.

James Currier:

You're welcome.

Roy:

No shamanism though.

James Currier:

My pleasure.

Roy:

\[crosstalk 00:07:37\], thank you James.

Minn:

Bye.

**DAY 127**

**How do I know if I should keep working on something vs pivoting?**

\[Guest: [Ray Shan](https://twitter.com/rayshan)\]

Roy:

... one of your questions about work and how to work. If you're new, I'm Roy, and together with Minn, we are startup investors in The Future of Work. This is our 127th day and question and we love having guests. And today we've got Ray Shan, who's at the Long-Term Stock Exchange, one of our favorite platforms to watch evolve, and we are talking about productivity.

Minn:

Totally, and Ray, well, before he was at the Long-Term Stock Exchange, which he can tell us a little bit more about, he's had a variety of experiences across products, software engineering, growth, including starting his own cotton apparel company, organic cotton apparel. And so we wanted to invite him to talk about this week, how to get things done. And so the question that I have for you, Ray, is, "How do I know if I should keep working on something or pivoting?" And it sounds like you've made a number of different pivots over your career. So what do you think?

Ray Shan:

Yeah, certainly. First of all, thank you very much for having me here. It's an honor and I've enjoyed your show a lot, I've watched a lot of episodes.

Roy:

Awesome.

Ray Shan:

Yeah. So this is a really good question then, honestly, a really hard question to get right. LTSE is my fourth startup and frankly I still have a hard time with it and certainly made a number of mistakes. But I do think it's an important question to get right because I think deciding when to pivot and how to pivot fast is what separates productive teams from teams that are not as productive. So actually, I can give you a bad...

Minn:

\[inaudible 00:01:35\].

Ray Shan:

I can give you a bad example of what not to do. So at my last startup, we were building a search engine for schools. So it's a little bit like a Google Scholar competitor, right? The core technology was a knowledge graph back behind the scenes generated by AI and the idea is that we'll generate more relevant search results for our users, right? But then, at the same time, we were like, Well, we want it to be a little bit different than Google Scholar. We don't want to just show a bunch of blue links."

Ray Shan:

So we actually spent six months building a really fancy 3D UI with a graph that literally represents a knowledge graph behind the scenes. It was a ton of work and at some point after you work on it for a while, that the sunk cost fallacy kind of set in and you're like, "Oh shit, I did a bunch of work. I don't want to... "

Roy:

You paid for it \[crosstalk 00:02:22\] might not have been worth it.

Ray Shan:

Yeah. Oh, and on top of that, it took us two months to prepare for a trade show because we were selling to universities, so it was one of these school trade shows. And you would think that, after all that work and after going to the trade show, meeting all the buyers, the hockey stick would just commence, right? Like the users are just going to take off, but like all other startups that did not happen, the first try, and what we actually learned was that the users didn't care about the fancy UI. They actually preferred the blue links. Google actually did something right because the blue links are simple and what they really cared about was how relevant the search results are.

Ray Shan:

So we actually could have just tested the data and the search results without spending all six months building the UI. So I think that's an example what not to do and I got some learnings from that about how we can do better and how we can pivot faster.

Roy:

So you're saying that it's less about the... Sorry, Minn, about the judgment of whether to pivot or not as it is the speed of iteration.

Ray Shan:

Yes.

Roy:

I love that because then the consequences, one of the things that we often see in startups is, and I think it's just true generally in work life, is if you're faced with a choice that seems monumental, figure on how to get out of needing to make that choice is often the best way to do it. Instead of weighing big things on the scales of justice, it's like, "Well no, if we only iterated five times faster, then this would be a lower \[inaudible 00:03:46\] decision and we wouldn't sweat it as much." So I love that insight.

Ray Shan:

That's right, absolutely.

Roy:

Sorry, Minn.

Minn:

I was going to say, if you had to make that choice again, is there something you would've done differently?

Ray Shan:

Yeah, I would say two things that come to mind. One is really knowing what the vision of the company is. What is it that we're here to do? So to backtrack a little bit, what is a pivot? At LTSE, we define the pivot as, a change in strategy without a change in vision. So the prerequisite of that is that you have to know where your vision is, and an example comes to mind. So if you think about Instagram. Instagram is one of probably the most famous pivot examples ever, and actually, it started out as Burbn, which is a location-based sharing company and kind of like Foresquare, and it didn't really take off. But Burbn was created to essentially help their users to share their daily lives.

Ray Shan:

So they did the pivot, which is a change in strategy without a change in that vision. So Instagram is still an app to help people to share their daily lives, but they took the nugget from Burbn. That's the most important, the picture that people attach to all the status updates, right? That's what people really wanted to see and cared about and wanted to be creative with. So they completely changed their strategy. It's a different app, different name, different brand, different everything, but the vision didn't change.

Ray Shan:

So I think that the first thing that comes to mind is you really have to know what your vision is and what you are here to do for your users. If you know that well, then it's easy to change your strategy and tactics.

Roy:

One of the things that I think, just before we run out of time, would be great to hear about is, as people have watched the Long-Term Stock Exchange evolve, applying that pivot and lean and fast iteration philosophy to scientific method for startups to something that seems like it has to really get it right because you're dealing with really consequential choices about the companies that choose to list and it's been something that I think people are just like, "Hey, how would that work in something like the Long-Term Stock Exchange?" It would just be great to hear a little dot on how does it work in that context?

Ray Shan:

Absolutely. So certainly, in Exchange, it's very difficult to build... The last time, it was built before LTSE was like 80 years ago or something. So the way that we think about this is that we try to break a bigger problem down into smaller problems. So we always start with a hypothesis. So the hypothesis of the Long-Term Stock Exchange is that we can build a better environment for companies to be public in. But what does that mean? There are a couple of components of it. One is that the better environment means that we want the companies to do something right for the long-term and for them to get credit for it in the public market.

Ray Shan:

So that comes in the form of listening standards. As a stock exchange, our superpower is that we can regulate, we can essentially hold the companies accountable to our listening centers. So we ask them to do certain things that's good for investors, good for stakeholders. And the MVP we build for that is \[inaudible 00:06:56\] are essentially a set of rules, and we can iterate very quickly by essentially writing them down on paper, going to all the stakeholders, testing them out and the stakeholders being founders, investors, regulators, and whatnot.

Ray Shan:

So we can iterate very quickly on that front and that sort of separate that hypothesis and that MVP from building the exchange itself. Now building the exchange, like you said, it's certainly a very complicated thing. There's a giant thick book of rules that we have to meet, right? We think of that less as an experiment and more as a service dealer ripple. There are certain things that you have to do as a business, like meeting your regulator demands or answering your customer's phone calls. Those, we kind of sort of put in a separate bucket. So I think these apply to more mature businesses. You continue to experiment with new ideas, but at the same time, you're delivering guaranteed services for your stakeholders.

Roy:

Awesome.

Minn:

Oh, that's great. Wow. So if anybody wants to learn more about the Long-Term Stock Exchange, you can find Ray and LTSE on Twitter or anywhere else. Thanks so much, Ray, for joining us today. We're so thrilled to have you, and we'll be back tomorrow about more how to get things done questions. And so if you have any, leave them down below in the comments and we'll be back tomorrow.

Roy:

Yeah, to be continued. Thank you, Ray.

Ray Shan:

Thank you.

Minn:

Thanks, Ray. Bye.

**DAY 128**

**How can I motivate my team when I'm in a slump?**

Roy Bahat:

Yay, time for another one of your questions about work. And if anybody's new, Minn and I are startup investors in the future of work, and we take one of your questions every day.

Minn:

And today is day 128. We've been talking this week about productivity and getting things done, and so this one touches on teamwork and how to get things done together. And so we're answering, "How do I motivate my team when it feels like we're in a slump?"

Roy Bahat:

Yeah, it's a tricky one, because as the leader, you both feel responsible when things are hard and you want to get people out of it. And so, alternating ... There's this myth that the way you motivate people is with relentless positivity, always goodness, goodness, goodness, goodness. And I think the reality is it's only a myth because it's not reliable. It works for some teams some of the time. Some people are different some of the time. If you want to be able to motivate, you have to find out what it is that people want, and what people want is going to vary from one culture to another, it's going to vary from one person to another, and it's going to vary for you over time.

Roy Bahat:

The hardest version of this question to me is when you personally are feeling like you're in a slump. Maybe the company's even doing great, maybe your team is doing great, but you're just feeling down. And you, as the leader of the team, have this double role where you're both responsible for the team's performance and you may be the team's greatest asset. So working on yourself first and just trying to figure out, do you have the support you need to get better? And then recognizing that you are going to have a leadership style that's going to mesh with others on the team.

Roy Bahat:

For example, you might discover that actually admitting that you're in a slump is the very best way to motivate people, because they feel connected to you as an individual. Now, of course, you can overdo it, because nobody wants to work for somebody who is constantly struggling, but timing and dosage.

Minn:

Totally, and it brings up two things. One is we actually came off of a virtual team offsite last week, and I feel like ... And Roy, you reminded us as our team to say that, like, "Work, yes, we work hard and we care about what we do and it's professionally enriching, but it should also be fun." And the thing that I thought was really a nice touch is that the person on the team that I think is the most fun is actually somebody else that isn't necessarily the leader of the team. Not to say that you are not fun-

Roy Bahat:

No \[crosstalk 00:02:48\]

Minn:

\[crosstalk 00:02:48\] Angela is actually really fun.

Roy Bahat:

Yeah. I'll admit that in a work context, I'm not that much fun. I want to do things and I feel like things are meaningful and I try to be ... I try to understand people, but I don't feel particularly fun. And so I was kind of putting that out in the universe just hoping somebody else grabbed the mantle and made it fun. It doesn't have to be me.

Minn:

Right. But I think you giving that permission for other people to step up and introduce the fun to the team, and so having somebody else who wants everybody to do a cooking class together, that also creates, I think, a different kind of motivation that feels collective in a way.

Minn:

And then the other part is, the team is this big entity, but it's made up of individuals, and so motivating when it feels like the team is in a slump also, I think, requires understanding where each one of the people are coming from. So, what you're saying about if you're the leader of a team, recognizing where you're coming from, extending that same mentality to each and every person that you are working with.

Roy Bahat:

Yeah. I mean, my fundamental idea of management is meaning working with people in a leadership capacity, but I'm talking about the part of it that isn't the big inspiration, but just the day-to-day work together. It's a trade. Understand what they want, understand what you and the organization need, and trade. And you know, that makes it sound a little bit transactional because it doesn't actually feel like that, it feels like a relationship. But generally speaking, you want to understand what people want, and help them understand that by doing something great for the company, they can get that thing.

Minn:

Totally. Okay. Well, we are here every Monday through Thursday, so we're going to be off tomorrow, but tell us your questions about startups, about work. I think we're going to try to do some things on management and being a founder in the coming weeks as well with some special guests, so-

Roy Bahat:

Yay.

Minn:

... let us know. And anything else, Ray?

Roy Bahat:

To be continued.

Minn:

To be continued.

**DAY 129**

**How do I establish my credibility when I'm not the expert?**

\[Guest: [Earnest Sweat, Associate Partner @ GreatPoint VC](https://twitter.com/earnestsweat)\]

Roy:

Another one of your questions about work and if you're new, I'm Roy, and I'm here with Minn most days. Today is our 129th day of doing this. And we love having guests. And Earnest, I just like having excuses to talk to you, which is honestly, part of the whole agenda for getting you here. Earnest is an investor with Great Point, which invests in health and wellness, and enterprise. Early stage, generally, up thorough Series B. And Minn, what are we talking about?

Minn:

Well, this week, we're tackling some of these questions around establishing credibility, managing your reputation. And Earnest, I feel like you have some really great perspectives because we just learned that you started your career as an equity researcher, and then more recently, have been in venture for several years now. And so the question we wanted to ask you was, how do I establish my credibility when I may or may not be the expert quite yet?

Earnest:

Yeah. And thanks Roy and Minn for having me here today. It's always a pleasure. I love speaking to you guys and have an excuse anytime I can, too. So, it's a mutual feeling. So how do you become an expert when you're not really an expert or maybe not have the confidence? This is a question I had to deal with when looking to go into venture. I had moved out here to San Francisco after business school, which costs a lot for a, at the time, I thought, a very dream job. So I was one of those type A people who wrote about exactly what he wanted to do after business school and was crazy enough and actually got it. It was within nonprofit consulting.

Roy:

Those type of people, I always feel inferior, so I'm happy we're talking about this. Keep going now.

Earnest:

So it actually happened. And so then I moved out here to San Francisco in the summer of 2013, working for a nonprofit consulting firm, probably the top nonprofit consulting firm. And loved the firm, but I quickly realized that consulting wasn't a great fit for me. I'd worked in equity research, as you mentioned, Minn, before, starting out in my career and the problem I even had with that role was, it was too far away from actually having skin in the game. You were making recommendations as a research analyst, but you didn't put any money in. And when you're a consultant, you're helping people scope out their biggest problems and just giving them a playbook that they may or may not use. So I went back to, my summer internship in business school at Kellogg was actually at a venture philanthropy, a group called Central Square. And it was in New Delhi, India. I guess I'm burying the lead there. So I was in New Delhi, India for that summer. And so that-

Roy:

And you are not an expert in the Indian venture capital market \[inaudible 00:00:02:53\].

Earnest:

Not at all, but sometimes people will take shots on you. But it focused on education technology in areas that I tried to start in a tech company slash non-profit before. And so that role, just going into that role, and I'll get back to the story, that was the one that really put a light bulb in my head that, oh, what I was doing in equity research is very similar to venture capital. It's just a lot earlier, not public information, and you need to be a journalist to figure out all these desperate pieces of information in coming up with a thesis, and then acting on it. And so, really loved that job, so then as I was sitting in my apartment, out of work after having, essentially failing at this dream job, I was like, what's next?

Earnest:

And I was like, oh, maybe I'll try to venture. And so that's when I needed to, I was like, okay, can I get into venture? I'm not an expert. And I had a lot of points or just ways in which I could go, paths I could go. And the initial thought was okay, go after whatever's hot. Become an expert in what's hot. So, this is 2014, 2015, so you're thinking about more market, consumer or simply just anything that is horizontal SAS. And I don't know, I just told you briefly about my background. I don't know anything about those.

Roy:

\[inaudible 00:04:28\].

Earnest:

And so I got some... First of all, I was lucky enough to get some early interviews with some small funds and corporate VCs. And it's kind of a scene right out of Silicon Valley. I, a former banker, came in with a suit in the Palo Alto offices and was probably instantly taken off consideration. But through those interviews and networking my butt off, I learned what I needed to gain to become this expert. VC firms are looking for individuals who want to have network with entrepreneurs and other investors, and to have some, what they call, superpower. It's probably overused as a term. But to double-click on that, essentially what they're looking for is, do you have an expertise in a functional area? And so functional is really important because if you, let's say were number 50 at some unicorn start-up, the thought is you understand how to grow that company, a \[inaudible 00:05:31\] company like that. You understand the experience, you know what to look for, you know what the telltale signs are, and you could probably predict what the next company will be, in that area. So that could be engineering, sales, whatever.

Earnest:

The other super power, which is more, that was going to be better for me was, do you have a clear understanding of an industry? And so given I was in equity research covering real estate investment trusts, I, at 22, had spoken to a ton of senior leadership executives. CEOs, chief IR officers, and presented my view on their public company. And so I understood what those companies were doing today and understood where their gaps were. And so I tried to lean in on, as a foundation, I was not throwing away my experience like it was trash, but how can I use it? It's still a treasure.

Earnest:

So, I knew real estate. I knew financial services and I tried to start a tech company. And so that's where I took my foundation. I was like, okay, I'm going to know those three areas really well. I have some advantages and now I need to understand what's happening. If I understand what's happening in the later side, the public side, how can I understand what's happening in the earlier stages that can attack those gaps? And so that's what kind of led me to go in tactical ways in which, okay, how do I build that muscle and that knowledge base that I can be seen as an expert?

Roy:

Yeah. And I love that insight that, you figured out the language of the overall game, that they were looking for certain things, and then you just went selective in a few areas. There is no such thing in our world as anybody who's an expert in everything. And, repeated discussion of something gives you a sense of the language, which is so much of like, you were talking about the language, the sartorial language of what you were wearing. And so much of it, I find it's just like word choice in one domain versus another. And then you're saying, okay. And then I pick, among all these different areas I could have known, I picked a few, and then I made sure \[inaudible 00:07:34\] as well. I love that. At least, you're having some area where you are confident can often, in my experience, be enough because nobody is confident in every area.

Earnest:

Yeah. And so my story, like I was kind of skipping some steps, but essentially did the market research. I quickly also saw one of my feedback points from firms was, you really don't have any high growth experience because your startup only got to a certain point at the angel stage. So the way to kind of hack that is I have these three areas and I identified accelerators that were outside of the Bay area. That were emerging in those verticals. And that way I got to work with those accelerators and gleaned from what the entrepreneurs were going through, to identify, okay, which types of entrepreneurs are doing best in this industry? What are the common problems that they face? What am I really good at and what do I get passionate about in helping them? And so, is it helping with pitch decks, is it helping them network to get, fundraise? Is it helping with the sales strategy?

Earnest:

And so, that really helped me, too. I worked at Camelback Ventures, and EdTech, and Education Accelerator based in New Orleans. And that really started to give me a path. And so then I was starting to get some content and now I need to actually be comfortable with sharing it. And I think this is where advantage of your previous experience, equity research, my whole job was pontificating and giving out a point of view that could instantly be wrong. And so you need to be comfortable with being wrong, because information changes. You never know. And so, that really gave me the confidence of... Someone early on gave me advice that you should start blogging, which I was completely against, especially before getting into venture. And then I realized when they told me, you shouldn't think about going viral. Who cares about that? What you should want is to have a repository of a thought resume.

Earnest:

And so, when people see that, oh, we're going to interview this guy or we're thinking about bringing him in, he actually cares about venture. He cares about technology. He has a point of view. I don't agree with his point of view, but at least he has a thought process. And so that's what people want. They want those go getters that are passionate about it. because a lot of times you might not, even if you get direction, we're all using old information. And this is very important right now as no one has invested before, during, or after a pandemic. So the industry is actively changing underneath our feet.

Minn:

I love that. I love the idea of a thought resume. And I'm just going to highlight that, this was years in the making for you, too. And so, this idea of credibility and establishing expertise doesn't come after just three or four viral tweets. It's, for you, years of building relationships and sharing your knowledge and taking feedback from other people who were asking you questions about, oh, I don't know, do you know? And then saying actually, yeah, I did some more work in coming back. And so I feel like this is just the beginning of a longer conversation, so we really appreciate you being here today. And so that was Earnest, not advice, given.

Earnest:

Yeah. It was not advice.

Roy:

Yeah, thank you. We really appreciate it. No. Real life experience, but I think it was great. All right. To be continued.

Minn:

To be continued.

Earnest:

Thanks guys.

**DAY 130**

**How do I get honest \(anonymous\) feedback on a really small team?**

\[Guest: [Candice Brackeen](https://twitter.com/candicebrackeen), Founder, Lightship Capital\]

Roy:

Welcome back everybody. It is time for another one of your questions about work. If you're new, I'm Roy. I'm a startup investor in the future work. Today is our 130th day, and on several of those days, I've noticed that Candice, our friend and co-conspirator, has been in the comments or sending some feedback, and so it is especially wonderful to have Candice Matthews working here with us today. She is GP founder of LYSHA Capital, which does a live pitch themselves over Twitch that you will tell us about in a minute. We're going to talk today about a thing that tends to happen in small organizations, including venture capital firms, which is, and something I'm really in to, which is we get better by getting feedback. Getting honest feedback often requires people to be willing to speak anonymously or sometimes can require it. On a small team, it's one thing, like big companies send out one of those surveys, like a hundred people, and you get aggregated responses. Candice would love to hear your perspective on when the team is small how do you make sure you get that honest feedback that you need to grow?

Candice:

Yeah. It's really hard, and I think we're growing through it at the moment. At LYSHA between the foundation and the fund, we have 14 team members, so it's actually like quite a few people, and so we get really good feedback during all team meetings. Sometimes, I mean, occasionally feelings get hurt during those all-team meetings when someone drops the ball on a project or something like that. Things are routed a few ways. I let the team know, "Yes, Brian and I are married. If you don't feel comfortable with coming to either one of us, I have a board member that I know, like, and trust, and you can go to that person at any point.

Roy:

I love that.

Candice:

That's hard, I think, for a lot of founders to do, to give that access. I know that every day I'm doing the right thing for work, and I want to make sure that I'm holding a really high regard.

Roy:

I loved that.

Candice:

Here's a board member that you can talk to if you feel like it needs to go outside of this team. Yeah. Then secondarily, our chief of staff, just like me, she's a 40 something year old mom, we have a couple of 47 year old moms, reach out to a den mother and see if that person will be helpful. A lot of times that solves the issue.

Roy:

I love that. I mean, the idea of having that release valve of a person who you designated as the, it's like the official intermediary. I feel like it would be a lot easier to go to somebody as long as you trust that person and trust them to be neutral. I loved the idea of handing teammates the power to go outside the structure to somebody to whom you yourselves are accountable. We have on our website, we have a version of this, which when founders talk to us. If you're a founder and you talk to a VC and you're unhappy, well, where do you go? You're going to go to that VCs limited \[inaudible 00:00:03:07\], you can't know that. We have a designee on a website who's somebody at Bloomberg who's willing to receive that.

Roy:

I think that that problem of creating a safe channel is one that as an industry we're still really new at. Will you just say, before we run out of time, so thank you for that. I really appreciate the not advice there. It is something you have done. Just for everybody who may be tuning in anew, the reason we call this this is not advice is because when somebody is giving you advice on what to do, they're usually telling you how to live their life, and we're just sharing our experiences as people who study our work functions, and you make your own choices about how to live your life.

Candice:

Yeah.

Roy:

Just two quick fact questions before we lose you. One is what kind of founders should pitch LYSHA?

Candice:

Oh goodness. All right. One who sits in the mighty middle, that's in the center of the country, who's leading a company that is focused on consumer packages goods and services, e-commerce sustainability, artificial intelligence, and healthcare, and they come from a diverse background, BiPAP women, those who identify as LGBTQ, or those who are disabled.

Roy:

Awesome. Then how did the Twitch pitches work?

Candice:

Oh, Twitch pitch is great. Tuesday and Thursday night on Twitch. It also streams to all of our platforms. That one is industry agnostic. We take any company that is high growth and venture backable.

Roy:

You're just feedbacking basically.

Candice:

Yeah. What was it?

Roy:

You're giving them feedback whether or not it's a fit for you.

Candice:

We're giving them feedback, and then at the end of the season, we give the winner $25,000.

Roy:

Oh wow.

Candice:

Yeah. We've had three winners so far from the first three seasons and they've raised $6.3 million since July.

Roy:

I love it. As a person who was in the video game business when Justin.TV made the rename, and we were involved as a supportive partner, seeing all the different ways that Twitch has come to life is amazing.

Candice:

That's cool.

Roy:

I love that Candice. Will you please come back another time and we'll do another question that's something you want to talk about?

Candice:

Absolutely.

Roy:

All right. Thank you everybody. To be continued and thank you, Candace.

Candice:

Thanks Roy.
