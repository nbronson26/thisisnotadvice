\*\*\*\*[**How should we split equity among the co-founders?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1BdxYnEeABXKX)

There is no one right answer to how to split equity shares among co-founders, but it is important to consider all the factors that can influence this decision and to include these factors in your conversation about sharing equity.

How you should split equity among co-founders is an important decision that you shouldn’t take lightly. It is important as, firstly, if you regret your decision later, it can be hard to fix and secondly, your views on the subject will probably change-- when the person who you thought was going to be really valuable turns out to be a dud, you will have to manage that and deal with the fact that their shares don’t reflect their involvement.

When people approach equity shares, they usually have a conversation that is purely about those equity shares. Really, the conversation should be about much more. In addition to equity shares, you can also talk about how much money the person has, what role money plays in their life, what role a feeling of ownership plays, how much control over what happens is involved, and how important identity is. All of these things play important roles in the division of equity.

Something that can help you ask these critical questions is [The Partnership Charter,](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/235803.The_Partnership_Charter), where psychologist and business mediation expert David Gage offers a comprehensive guide to the art of establishing and maintaining a partnership. The charter works for everything from marriages to business partnerships, and talking through the questions and answering them can benefit startup founders too. Asking the full inventory of important questions can be really hard, so starting with the Partnership Charter can be useful.

Once you have gone through the questions, you can identify the factors that should influence your decision. There is no one-size-fits-all for sharing equity, for some 50-50 works out well, whilst others can benefit from more unusual splits, like Uber who gave 90% to founders who weren't even full-time with the business.

Deciding on a number is a process of triangulation, and ideally you want to get to a place where everybody's feelings are known, regardless of whether they are happy or unhappy, and you can work with everyone’s feelings as things unfold.

With startups, long vesting periods can be beneficial. The market standard is a four-year vest, meaning you earn into your shares over four years. Founders typically don't have the "cliff" where an employee will vest over four years, but not get anything until the end of year one when they get a year all at once. Founders generally vest all the way through. Long vesting periods can seem daunting, but when you think about the fact that companies generally take a decade to succeed, having a 10-year vest doesn't seem that crazy. These long vests triangulate with many factors. It's not just about the money, or the fairness, or any one factor. It's about all of them, and you need to use the conversation about equity to get them on the table.

You probably won’t care about your vesting period and equity shares unless you find yourself in the scenario where the company has been successful, but you only stayed for a while and then you got pushed out or left. In this case, you're probably going to end up having your stake renegotiated for you anyways. The next investor is going to say, "I don't want this person who's no longer involved at 15%, so as a condition of my investment, you need to go renegotiate that."

Sharing equity is not just about money, it also involves other factors. In order to cover these factors in your conversation, you can ask questions and figure out how everyone is feeling.

\*\*\*\*[**My company is growing. How do I keep track of what's going on?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1ynKOqDDjoQJR)\*\*\*\*

As your company grows, you might find that you are no longer able to keep track of what is going on and stay on top of everything. Once you have accepted this, you can focus on staying on top of the important things, which can be identified using a sensing system.

The first part of this answer is: don't try and know everything that is going on. Instead of trying to stay on top of everything, solve the problem by coming to the realization that you can’t stay on top of everything. Struggling to manage everything is common when your company grows and you hire more people to get leverage. With this growth, you’re probably going to need to operate at a different level of structure. Bringing more people on means that you are going to need to get comfortable with not knowing, and let your team do what they were hired to do. 

The second part directly follows the first part: if you know that you aren’t going to pay attention to everything, how will you pay attention to the right things? 

A way to make sure that you know about the right things is to have a sensing system in place. A sensing system will tell you when something goes wrong, or especially right, and will draw your attention to what needs input from you. Your sensing system can be through software, human processes, or interactions with different people. What form your sensing system takes is not important, as long as it allows you to understand the complex organism that is your company.

\[Ed.: When Dan was at Medium, the team grew to a size where he could no longer know what each team member was doing. Dan felt that he didn’t know much about what his Eng team was up to, and so when it came to reporting their progress to the Exec team, he didn’t have much to share. 

He then started having those Eng teams try and send him a report on Friday that he could then relate to the Exec team. But unfortunately, this wasn’t successful as noone wanted to report to him just for the sake of reporting to him. 

So, he ended up creating a sensing system that could broadcast information to the whole company. Instead of team members giving information to him, he facilitated the flow of  information to the rest of the company. He was then able to highlight their work and represent it to the company through the weekly engineering report.\]

Creating a broadcasting system like Dan’s is one way to set up a sensing system, but really what you need are rituals and cadence. The sensing system is built on top of rituals, and they have to be weekly, daily, monthly, and yearly. You can then build up that cadence of communication. 

One way to incorporate a ritual is by using Range. If your team checks in with you routinely, you can assess how they are answering the team question and how their mood is. You can use these things to decide if you should look at something in more detail and go into their day-to-day work. Noticing when your team members aren’t acting as they usually do can allow you to be alerted when they are struggling or need more support. 

You may think that a sensing system is about dealing with information that is present, but it is actually also about dealing with the absence of information. Oftentimes, when people on a team are struggling, they stop being forthcoming in their communication. In these cases, you take notice of the absence of information. If someone you usually hear from every day suddenly goes quiet, that is your signal that something may be wrong. 

As your company increases in size, you probably aren’t going to be able to know everything that is going on in your company. Instead, you can strive to know the important things, which a sensing system can help bring to your attention.

\*\*\*\*[**Can I change my company name?**](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1MnGndwoeZyxO)

If you believe that changing your company name is the best thing for your business, the process of doing so is challenging and long, but still entirely possible. 

\[Ed.: Spike is the founder of "Newfront", which was once called “Abe Insurance.” There are a number of reasons why you may want to change your name, but for Spike, the fact that many people thought Abe was an acronym and that he was associated with Shinzo Abe was reason enough.\]

There may not be one instance that makes you decide, “Okay, it’s time to change our company name.” But if there has been an accumulation of consumer conversations where your name was identified as something that they can’t relate to or deterred them in some way, you might want to consider changing it. \[For Spike, one of these conversations included a broker telling him that he would join their company in spite of their name.\]

If you decide that it is necessary to change your name, you might be tempted to delay the process for as long as possible. Like exercise, changing your name can become something that stays at the back of your mind. You know you need to do it, but you never get around to actually doing it. 

There are many approaches you can take when trying to come up with a new name. You might choose to speak to someone who has experience with company names, who will ask you questions like, "Imagine how the name makes you feel." \[Ed.: Although this may work for some people, Spike believes that they spent too long doing this.\] Alternatively, you could get creative and try combining words to create a name. 

No matter what approach you take, if you are selling or working in an existing market, you will probably come to the realization that almost every name is already taken. This may not be a problem if you're in crypto, but if you, like Spike, are working in a well-developed market like insurance, you will see that in order to have something unique, you will have to make up a name that isn’t an existing word or something that you would usually think of.

You may decide to change the name of the corporation or just your DBA, "doing business as" name. Your decision may be based on personal reasons, or legal reasons which sometimes require you to change the name of your corporation. Once you have picked the name for your corporation or DBA, the process of actually changing the name starts. If your company is already well-established and you are regulated by multiple states, have many licenses or have trading partners who you have legal relationships with, the process of changing your name can be a long and laborious one. \[Ed.: Spike’s law firm gave him a 2 page checklist to make the process easier. You can find it here.\]

You will see some things on the checklist that you probably would never have thought of. One of them is the fact that a lot of things are on payroll, especially if you have employees in multiple states. Something else to consider is if you are involved in a lawsuit, you will have to notify the courts of your name change. 

Another thing that can make the process difficult is if those you work with have different processes for updating their contracts. 

Once you have legally changed your name, you can begin to update your platform. This can be particularly challenging if you already have a complex product with your old name written all over it. An important aspect of this is securing a new domain. It isn’t always necessary to have a domain that matches your company’s name, but if it is for you, it might be best to secure it early so you don’t end up spending large sums of money buying it from someone. 

The process of changing your company’s name is undoubtedly a hassle \[Ed.: one that lasted about 6 months for Spike\], but it is something that can build value in the company in the long term.

[**As an early-stage founder, can I serve two customer segments at once?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1BdxYYjkRDAxX)

In general, serving two customer segments at once is not a good idea as it takes your focus away from making your product market-ready. An exception to this is founders who are not sure who their ideal customers are.

Focusing on getting your product fit for the market is incredibly important for new companies. Serving two customer segments can detract from this focus, even if it’s the same product and technology. Unless the end-to-end process is exactly the same, the process will probably not be similar enough to maintain the necessary level of focus. If you are going to successfully serve more than one customer segment, how you get the customer, what the customer wants, and how you communicate with the customer needs to be identical for both groups, which is very rarely the case.

Founders often don’t believe that focus will be an issue as they view themselves as being very focused. People sometimes think of focus as a glass of concentrated liquid, and as you add more and more things to focus on, you add more liquid and the focus becomes diluted. With this line of thought, adding just a bit of liquid will only dilute it slightly.

 A more useful analogy is thinking of your focus as a liquid and the things that require your attention as food coloring. When you add food coloring, even just a couple of drops, the new color will change the color of the entire glass. Adding more customer segments to your focus can change your entire process and affect your ability to focus. 

Despite this, there is one case where serving different customer segments can be helpful. This is when you're not yet sure who your focus customer type is or who your first customer will be. If this is you, you're in discovery mode, and so rather than focusing on making your product fit the customers, you are focusing on who your customers are. For a short period of time, you can serve different customer types and see which one is best for you, but doing this can become problematic if you serve too many customer types in too many ways. 

The number of customers you can experiment with depends on what type of enterprise you are. If you're in the slow burn enterprise sales business and you're selling $500,000 contracts with something that is deeply integrated, then you probably shouldn’t try too many customer types at once. On the other hand, if you're in a consumer-type thing where you have landing pages and you're just pinging out emails to people, you can go ahead and try many different types of customers at once.

Once you are done with experimenting and it comes to choosing a customer type, examine the reasons why you should or should not focus on one customer type. If you think you shouldn't focus on a customer segment, challenge this thought by asking yourself how you could make it work. When doing this, it can be helpful to imagine that you are trying to persuade a skeptic to choose that customer type.

Unless you are unsure of who your target customers are, serving multiple customer segments usually backfires as it negatively affects your ability to focus.

[**I'm an early-stage founder with two revenue streams, where each could make millions. Do I really need to quit one?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1LyxBdMwOnYGN)

If you are an early-stage founder with two revenue streams, you may want to consider quitting one so that you can narrow your focus on growing your company.

The majority of founders would benefit from keeping to a single revenue stream.

This is often difficult for founders as they have internalized the idea of, "Doing unscalable things," or, "The customer is always right." Despite these ideals, founders who have a goal of making something that can grow really big may do better with one revenue stream as simplicity is the fuel for scale.

The fact that it's very hard to find companies that had two revenue streams in the beginning and maintained them throughout seems to be evidence of how simplicity is often better.  

For those companies that do have multiple revenue streams, they generally add these later. An example of this is LinkedIn which had several revenue streams which came later.  

Although having one revenue stream is better, what can work is having a single business model where you charge both a license for your software and professional services to set it up. This can work as long as you have that single business model and you don’t have too many options. If you were to describe your situation by saying, "Well, some of our customers pay us this way and some of us pay us with SaaS and other ones pay us by the hour as consultants," then you may have too many options and this kind of complexity can kill. 

If you aren’t solving for “How big can I grow my company?” but rather, "How much revenue can I make as quickly as possible?" Then having multiple revenue streams is great. Instead of asking “do I need to quit one,” you may be asking, “Do I want to get out of it? And if so, why?”  

Not all revenue is created equal, and because of this, you may want to consider if the revenue you’re getting is representative of the revenue stream you would like. 

You may be reluctant to narrow it down to just one stream, but it's important to remember that, just like choosing a customer segment, choosing a revenue stream isn't a one-way door. You can change things later. In the beginning, what is important for your company’s growth is doing one thing well.

If you currently have multiple streams of revenue and you are ready to pick one, the one you should pick isn’t always the biggest one, or even the one with the most potential. It is the one that will result in the most valuable business for you in the long term. This could mean that one of the things enables other things to be easier later, or it could be that one supplies more profitable revenue, recurring revenue, or revenue that pulls you. Whatever your reasons are, the gravity of your choice should pull you in the direction of the kind of business you want to create. 

If your goal is to grow your company, then it’s a good idea to focus on a single revenue stream. The revenue stream that you choose should add to your business’s value in the long term and represent the kind of revenue that you wish to get.

[**Customers are asking us to build a new feature. Should we?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1BRKjBzXlEQKw)

When deciding to build a feature requested by a customer, you should consider how they requested it, who requested it, and if building it would make sense for your business and your business model.

If you are the person who is building things for customers or offering things to customers, your goal is to have judgment about what to build and to build things that satisfy your customers. Obviously, acting on a customer’s request can help you with the latter, but whether it is a good idea to build it depends on how they are requesting it.

Apart from how they’re asking, who is asking is also important. Deciding whose feature requests you want to prioritize is also a judgment choice that you have to make.

You probably don’t want to build features for the people saying, “Please build the apps because my boss would be really happy.” But if someone is asking for new features just by taking some actions and trying to use the product in a certain way, then acting on this can be great. Sometimes this is called paving the cow path. The customer creates the cow path by using the product in a certain way and then you systematize it.

Apart from how they’re asking, who is asking is also important. Deciding whose feature requests you want to prioritize is also a judgment choice that you have to make.

Whether you should build a new feature also depends on what your business model is. If you're a consultant building software for a client, then obviously paying attention to their requests is key. You can pressure test what they ask for a few times and make sure that it is feasible but, ultimately, your job is to build what they want.

If your business model is a standard kind of call-it product or service-driven product, you should attempt to find something scalable.  In a way, a request is data and the data tells you something about what the customers think they want. They may be right about what they want or they may not be, because none of us knows our own minds. Because of this, it's just data. If the data makes you think, "Oh, I know how to give them this thing that I believe they're telling me they really need," then you'll avoid falling into the Henry Ford thing of "If I gave my customers what they wanted, then I would have given them a  faster horse," which is often cited by Steve jobs. 

You can take the data and use your creative insight to apply your judgment and knowledge about the problem and make something that is absolutely special. 

An important thing to note is that it isn't just about what product or service you build, it's also about how the customer feels about the way you've handled their request. Whether it's one of a million people making a bug request or it's your enterprise customer who pays you millions of dollars a year, how you handle their feedback becomes a part of how they feel about the value that you delivered to them. Your customers won’t just remember what you said, but also your tone of voice while you held their hand-- it’s just like the Maya Angelou quote: “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”

One way some early-stage companies that receive a lot of user feedback have dealt with these requests is to have a public space where these requests are depicted. The space allows customers to view where what they want stacks up on the priority list. 

Whether you should build the features your customers ask for depends on how they ask, who asks and if it makes sense for your business model. If you decide to build their features or not, how you deal with the customer’s request is an important factor in their impression of your company.

[**If I'm still trying to identify who my early customers are, should I offer it for free?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1OwGWVaNnnkKQ)

Whether you should offer your product for free to identify customers depends on whether the customers will care if it is free or not, if it will attract the wrong kinds of customers, or if it will negatively affect how customers view your product. If you are very uncertain about who your customers are and how being free or paid will affect this, you may as well try being free.

When you are starting out, offering your product for free can bring you more customers. People are often more willing to take a chance on you when they don’t have to pull out their wallets. However, there are some markets where offering your product for free or requiring payment won’t make a difference to your early customers. This is when the market offers something that the customer absolutely has to have. For these customers, your product is not a want, but a necessity, and therefore, it doesn't matter to them what you price it-- they will get it. If you fall under this market, offering your product for free is unnecessary as it won’t help you identify who your early customers are.

Another thing to consider is how offering your product for free may change the type of customers you attract. Paid transactions have a completely different psychology compared to free transactions.  Because of this, if you offer your product for free, you may acquire a totally different type of customer. These customers may not be a good representation of who would be willing to pay and may not give you much data about what would happen if you upgrade to paid.

If the reason you want to offer your product for free is so that you can find your customers, you may want to rethink that.  Offering it for free might actually make finding your customers harder.  Paid might be the thing you need to do in order to figure out who wants to pay for the product. Bloomberg LP is an example of a business that discovered its customers whilst offering a paid product from the start. Although they waited a long time to sign their first customer, they never offered a mini version or free trial.

If your business model involves entering a market that is very competitive, then you should consider what the customers are going to have as a benchmark. If offering your thing for free is a differentiating factor, it can put you ahead of your competitors.

Just as a customer may be pleased by the product’s free status if it sets you apart from competitors, they could also see it as worrisome. They might be saying, “Oh, Why would I try this for free? This is actually really valuable for me and I want to be secure in knowing that my data is protected.” It may not be their data that they’re worried about, but paying for something brings certain connotations regarding quality, and some customers would be more willing to use a paid version.

If you are very uncertain, offering your product for free may be a good idea. If you have no idea about whether you should offer it as free or paid, and either option would be a guess, you may as well try offering your product for free. Although this is not necessarily the right primary strategy, it is a perfectly acceptable strategy.

An alternative route is to offer a kind of light version for free. Many SAS businesses start out with a freemium model where after some usage, be it number of calls, entries, etc. you have to start paying. Alternatively, it might offer limited options compared to the paid product. This can also give you an idea of who your customers are as you can see who has a willingness to pay and who converts to a paying customer. 

Offering your product for free can help you attract more customers, but they may be the wrong kind of customers. Making a product free is unnecessary if customers will use the product regardless, or if it has the potential to deter customers.

**DAY 105**

[**I'm an early-stage founder. When is it ok to build a second product?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1dRJZNzBzZXJB)

If you want to build a second product, you should ideally be able to hire someone who will be able to manage the first product. You may be able to skip this step in the experimental stages of product-building, but once you have committed to building it, focus is key and you should avoid splitting your attention.

 Most people try to build their second product too soon. Of course, this depends on what that second product is: is it a whole new line of business with a different revenue stream? Or is it just a new feature that is being added to your current product for the existing customers?  We will go ahead and assume that you’re asking about a second product that is a new value exchange with your current customers for which you will charge separately. 

It is generally OK to build a second product if you know you can hire somebody into the company who can manage the first product. The person you hire should be capable of being the primary manager and should ideally have the experience that proves they can manage the product as well as you \(the founder\) have been.

Usually in the beginning, the most important factor is the primary manager of the early product. For this reason, split attention rarely works out. A person will usually make the choice to split their attention after their first product has entered the market. 

What is important to remember is, even if your first product is in the market and doing well, you can’t afford to pay zero attention to it. If you’re at the point where your first product has been on the market for some time and is doing well, you probably have the bandwidth to do a second product, but having someone who can manage that first product is important. 

When you decide to build the second product, you open that workstream, and gaining back your focus can be a struggle. Of course,  it doesn't have to be this way and you can have an exit plan for when you want to stop but for many people, stepping on the brakes after you have committed to a second product is challenging.

For this reason, it is helpful not to commit right away if you have doubts that you will be able to focus on it. Typically, a new product won't simply form out of the blue, it will start as a process of testing and experimenting.  Beginning to do that testing is obviously different from fully committing. You can do the testing stage before you're ready to commit, but when you are ready to commit you need to have the ability to manage focus.

The litmus test for if you can build a second product is if you can hire someone who can efficiently manage the first product. Managing your focus may not be a problem when you are in the experimenting stage of product-building, but once you have committed to that product, focus is essential.

[**"I'm an early-stage startup founder. How much do I pay myself?"**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1lDxLpdobnwxm)

When trying to figure out what to pay yourself, consider what salary would be sustainable for you and what salary would be fair.

Early founders tend to underpay themselves. \[Ed.: This is a tough question because of course, as a white man, I'm going to have attitudes toward money and the availability of money which are not the same for other people of  different backgrounds.\]

If you’re looking for a number, then that can be anywhere from $0 to upwards of $125k. The number varies drastically depending on your needs. Your needs are what is important for the first principle of what to pay yourself. The first principle is: if your company can afford it, pay yourself enough so that you can do the job sustainably. Sustainably means that you can do the job without fear of what the effect of that salary will be on your life and you don’t need to increase the salary to be less fearful. Even if it's not the salary you would get a job where you weren’t a starting company, the salary should ideally be sustainable.

This principle seems pretty obvious, of course, you should pay yourself enough to survive, and yet, many founders still underpay themselves. Why is this?

The first thing is the startup may just not have money to pay them. In this case, founders can get back paid if they need to, in order to eliminate the distraction of money when they first get funded by investors.

If your business isn't going to be funded by investors and you just can't afford it, then you’re going to have to wait until you can afford it. This is easier said than done as sometimes you simply can't wait. 

Something that can prevent people from paying themselves a sustainable salary is a belief that their investors or backers will be unhappy with them if they take too much. This is especially true for people who are new to the startup ecosystem who may be fearful about voicing what it is that they need.  The answer to this potential problem is communication. 

\[Ed.: I started a company with a woman who was, at that time, the sole provider for a family of two kids. Her needs were different than that of other founders because of her life circumstances.

She and I were able to have a conversation about this with investors and although it didn’t always turn out the way we wanted, it allowed us to get closer to the result.\] 

The second principle is fairness. Fairness being that if every other startup founder who was appointed at a certain stage is making X, then maybe you should also make X. Many founders say, "Well, I don't need to make the money and therefore let's put it back in the business." Choosing to invest your salary into the business is your choice.

Many firms \(Bloomberg Beta included\) will help founders figure out what the pay benchmark is for a founder or other executives at their level. 

Although many founders underpay themselves, for most it is important that their salary is both sustainable and fair. If you are worried that your investors may disagree with the size of your salary, be honest about your needs and your life circumstances.

Day 107

[**How do I set new expectations with my teammates as a WFH parent?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1DXGyRgWmLgJM)\*\*\*\*

When setting new expectations, you are going to want to have a transparent conversation with your manager that not only outlines your problem or makes requests but also supplies a solution or a plan of action for the way forward.

Your managers aren’t following a rule book. They have to work on a case-by-case basis to create almost individual rule books for their individual employees. In order for them to make your rule book, they’re going to need to know about your needs, which you can fill them in on with a conversation.

Up until now, you may have been having short-term conversations with your manager about how you would get through the week. If this is the case, approaching your manager won’t be too hard, but now the conversation needs to steer in the direction of long-term planning.

If you need to set new expectations because there are issues, you should definitely raise these issues, but you should also try to propose a solution. Try to come to the conversation prepared with a plan that works for your childcare needs whilst allowing you to honour your work responsibilities. 

The more specific your plan is, the better. If you know you have to attend to your child every day at 11:00 AM, tell them that you are unable to be online during those hours and explain how you will restructure your day so that your team can contact you during other specific hours.

\[Ed.: When I was a management consultant, the junior people on the team had an issue where you couldn't really reliably predict when your workday would be over. If you wanted to go have dinner with a friend or something, you couldn't do it. But then one day someone I worked with said, "Next Thursday I've got a date at 8 PM." And so everyone just worked around the obstacle that he put there.\]

You should aim to be as transparent with your manager as possible. Although the pandemic has generally made people aware of the chaos and struggles that they and others face, your teammates and managers don't have a full picture of what's going on in your world. In order for them to be able to set up your success, you need to give them a clear picture of what your life is like. 

One thing to consider is the fact that conversations like the ones described above may need to happen again as your needs change. When asking for things, there are timing and dosage components. You may say, "I need X," but then a month later something changes and X needs to change too. For everyone, but especially for parents, not all of your requests are set in stone because you yourself are making it up as you go along.

A lot of managers will hear you out because they know that at the end of the day if you are unable to work, the team and company will suffer too.

Research shows that if managers don't take the time to figure out a way to keep their employees in the workforce and keep them happy and productive, they will lose huge amounts of money as the cost of retraining, and rehiring people to replace those they’ve lost is vast.

**Day 108**

[**How do I know if I'm being underpaid?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1MYGNmbvWlRKw)

\[Ed.: At Compaas, they spend most of their time talking to businesses about how they can be better at how they pay people, make better choices, better decisions, measure things well, and have good raise processes that are fair\]

When you are trying to determine if you are being underpaid, it is useful to compare your salary to people from the same organization’s salary. If no one in the company has a similar role, try to have a conversation about your pay with your leaders.

The way people traditionally look at it is, how am I being paid compared to how much I could get somewhere else? That's how you're being paid according to what is loosely referred to as the ‘market.’ Unfortunately, this isn’t always useful as the ‘market’ is a very broad thing and companies within it vary greatly. A more useful comparison is how much are you being paid compared to other people in the same organization. If you are earning less than other people in the market, but this is true for everyone at the company, then your company isn’t underpaying you-- they’re just paying you badly. 

If you’re going to figure out if you are being paid similarly to your coworkers, you are going to need to find out how much they earn. This can be done by having a simple conversation. You have the legal right to talk about your pay with your colleagues. This is easier said than done as talking about your salary can be awkward and difficult for many.

If you have identified someone that you trust to tell you how much they earn, you may want to say something like, "I expected my bonus to be more like x% and it was less. How are you feeling about it?” and go from there. Using language that shows self-ownership and explains what you are feeling and experiencing can be helpful.

Asking someone what they are earning may not be an option if you're at a tiny company or you are the only one in your role. If you don't have an internal comparable, what do you do?

No matter what you do or who you work for, you should be able to have a conversation with your leadership about how they are setting compensation. Pay transparency should exist where every employee knows why they make what they make and how they can make more. This is something that can be done at any size company. 

Obviously, this is an ideal and there are going to be some managers who are awkward about talking about salaries or companies who are unwilling to tell you anything. In this case, you are just going to have to make choices based on what you have. This sounds harsh, but sometimes leaving the company or getting help from outside sources is the best thing for you. Nobody is going to advocate for you as well as you can, so try to get your people around you, and don't be afraid to ask the people who are going to be open with you and care about you for help.

Although the major activity here is comparing your salary to other people’s salary, there are some things you can do before you even start earning that salary. Before you get the job, or before you even get offered the job, you have the right \(in California and other states\) to ask how much a job pays. You can ask this question at any point in the pre-hire process. There are a lot of ways companies can tap dance around this and avoid bringing it up with candidates but you can directly ask, “What is the pay range for this job?”

If you want to know if you are being underpaid, try to find out how much your company is paying other people in your position and compare your salary to theirs. If you are unable to make this comparison, attempt to have a transparent conversation with your leaders about your pay.

**DAY 109**

[**Do I take a lower salary for a job I really want?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1lDxLpZNePZxm)

If you are asked in an interview how much you expect to be paid, the number you supply is as important as how concrete the answer is. If you later believe that the company was unhappy with your answer, you should consider taking an intermediate step, like asking for more information, before you negotiate against yourself.

You may find yourself in the same boat as the woman who asked this question. She was interviewed for a job that she was very qualified for and it sounded like the company was really excited to hire her. During the interview, they asked her what her expectations were around compensation. She had already known going in what the range was, because it had been posted on their website.

She named her expectations around the higher end and then didn’t hear back from them over the next few days. She then noticed that the page had updated the pay range on their website. She now wondered, "Oh, am I not going to get hired because I'm too expensive?" In that case, should I go back and say, "I'd be willing to take a lower compensation."

When faced with the question of expected compensation, many people end up contemplating negotiating against themselves. The reason that people usually do this is fear. They're afraid that if they don't do this, they might not get the job. However, here's almost always an intermediate step.

An example of an intermediate step is not accepting the lower salary at the first time. Instead, you could get some information first. The woman could have gotten information by calling the person and saying, "Hey, I know I said X and the posted range on the job was this, and then I noticed you guys changed the range. What happened?", and then they might have given her some new information that could have helped her to decide. 

When answering that question of “How much do you want to be paid?” it isn’t only about the ask, it's also about the music with which you deliver it, ie. the concreteness. In general, when you make an ask, there is usually a headline of the ask \(what you are asking\) and then there is the concreteness of the ask \(how you’re asking\). What I mean by that is there's a huge difference between, “I would like to be paid $100,000 a year, take it or leave it,” versus, “I'd like to be paid $100,000 a year, but I understand that you've got to be fair and find comparables, I am willing to discuss it.” The former is set in concrete, whilst the latter is set in feathers. In between, there are a thousand hardnesses that you can choose from that will give the company openness to come back to you.

When negotiating your salary after you have stated your expected compensation, there is usually an intermediate step you can take before you have to go back and change your answer to how much you would like to be paid. The salary that you ask for is just as important as how you ask for it if you want the company to consider you.

**DAY 110**

[**When should I do user testing versus just shipping?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1MYGNmWvyPNKw)

One way to determine if you should do user testing rather than just shipping is to measure the risks and the unknowns. The higher the stakes and the more uncertainty there is around whatever you're doing, the more important it is to find shortcuts to put your stuff in front of customers. You probably want to get your products to customers before you spend many months or dollars trying to build the real thing. 

Often, user research gets a bad name because the conventional approach is often something like, "Let's just go out and talk to our users and try to understand them." Which is obviously important, but it doesn't get you much closer to what you're trying to do. Or it may be something like, "Let's go and look at how our users are already interacting with our product. And let's look for problems or opportunities." There’s actually a big gap in the middle, which is, before you're ready to build something, but after you have had enough conversations to validate that there's an opportunity in the market for your product, you can take shortcuts in order to build a realistic prototype and put it in front of customers. 

\[Ed.: John Zeratzky put this to good use when he worked with Slack. Slack had been live for about 12 months and although they had a graph that was going up into the right, it didn't show the fact that most of their early customers were other tech companies who already knew that their product was useful. Because of this, Slack was interested in gaining customers from other business areas outside of the tech field.

They had come up with a new approach to how they were going to market so they decided to run a [Design Sprint](https://www.gv.com/sprint/). Because the stakes were high and it would take months to build the things they needed, it was important that they got it right before they launched.

John spent a couple of weeks working with Slack, prototyping what the market would be like. They mocked up ads that were in magazines and had people go through onboarding. Through this process, John and his team were able to invalidate Slack’s clever onboarding solution, despite it being very sophisticated.  They also found the solution that was most likely to work: standard tool tips that showed you how to use the product when you started Slack for the first time. \]

Another thing that is important is how many assumptions or unknowns are there at the customer interface? This isn’t referring to the UI, but rather how many of the risks of what you are doing are because of what people will think or do when they learn about it.

There's a myth regarding user research being about proving that the product will work. What it really is is spending time on certain techniques to save yourself a lot of time in the future if you’ve built something that won't work.

Something that everybody should consider doing during a Design Sprint is a set of realistic mock-ups, either of the product itself or the marketing for that product. This is a really cool hack because you can usually prototype the marketing faster than you can prototype the thing. You can do this using something like [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com), [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com), or even [Figma](https://www.figma.com).  Once you have this, you should go out and find five dream customers who fit your perfect profile.  Go and put your thing in front of them and see if the lights light up. 

If they don't, there's probably some issues and you need to go back to the drawing board. You can do all of this in just a couple of days whilst ignoring all of the really hard technical stuff like, How youre going to build it, or is it going to scale. You can temporarily ignore all those things and just focus on the customer interface.

[**What do I do if my co-founder and I disagree on our company vision?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1LyGBdvwvoExN)

If you and your cofounder cannot agree on your company’s vision, try to have a conversation where you determine exactly what you don’t agree on.

You often hear that people break up a band, or a group, due to ‘creative differences.’ Sometimes you hear that these ‘creative differences’ are a disagreement about a particular thing. Usually, this disagreement is actually about something else. The reason it's almost always about something else is that co-founder relationships are so multi-faceted and complex. They're personal and intense; they’re about money, your workday, your family life, and your social life. Because your relationship with your co-founder extends to so many aspects of your life, some of these aspects are bound to be hard to talk about. Naturally, we would rather talk about the things that we are comfortable talking about, and so we have arguments about these things. 

The first thing to do is figure out what you really have differences over. This is especially important if what you are arguing about is your ‘vision,’ as your vision is particularly amorphous and ambiguous. Is it really over what you think it is? Having an open conversation about how you and your co-founder are feeling can be helpful to discover what you are disagreeing on. Even if your views on what the company should do to succeed differ greatly, you should still try to work something out and see the best in each other.

Ultimately, there can only be one set of actions that the company takes. You may be faced with deciding on this set of actions and trying to figure out who has the power. If one of you can't convince the other to see it their way, then you may settle it by going with who has more equity, or you may choose to push the other person out. This is an example of a case where a simple disagreement can quickly escalate through a series of actions that can culminate in pushing the other person out.

Sometimes when you are in disagreement with your co-founder, the thing you think you disagree on isn't the real issue. Figuring out the real problem is key to resolving the matter or deciding to escalate it.

[**How much do the holidays matter in timing my fundraise?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1dRKZNwelBDKB)

Although the holidays affected fundraising in the past, it is no longer a big issue, especially for early-stage founders.

In the past, it mattered a lot. When there were only a few fancy VC firms that looked like law firms, thighs would really slow down on holidays or when they took leave from the office. There definitely used to be truth behind the traditional advice that annual timing mattered.

Now though, if you're an early-stage founder and you're raising your first institutional money, it doesnt really matter. For you, it is better to raise as soon as you can get money from trustworthy people. Don’t stress about the calendar and rather take the money or seek the money from people on fair terms wherever you can.

If you are in the early stage, the investor’s part probably won’t take months. It will take mere days or weeks. And so holidays won’t make as much of a difference because even if you started last week and Thanksgiving is this week, that week isn't going to make or break a huge difference.

If you are an early-stage founder, don’t worry about your fundraising being over the holidays and rather focus on getting money from people you trust.

**DAY 113**

[**Someone wants to buy my company. Should I engage?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1ypJdgzOmzaGW)

If you’re approached by someone who wants to buy your company, you should determine how you feel about it, what company wants to buy, and who is reaching out to you.

The first question is just asking yourself where are you on this? The answer is often that there is a price at which you could be bought, but you are unsure. Figuring out whether the acquisition interest is substantial enough to be worth exploring is part of the game.

The next question is, who is the company? Oftentimes, the interest is from a company you haven't heard of before. If you haven't heard of them and you can't find things about them online, that's a really bad sign. Now it doesn't necessarily mean you shouldn't engage, but it does mean you need to compensate for it by making them pre-qualify their interest.

The last thing is, who is reaching out? Big companies often have a corporate development team that does nothing all day but say, “Hey, we'd like to talk to you about a potential acquisition.” This person may just be talking to you because they are trying to make an acquisition slide and they are talking to not only you, but numerous people who occupy a similar space in the market. Hearing that someone wants to talk to you about acquisition may tempt you to drop everything to have that discussion, but keep in mind that the person on the phone may just be executing orders in corporate development. 

Not only is the who important, but also the why. Why is this person reaching out to me? If this person is in corporate development, then they're probably either doing some form of research, or somebody specifically asked them to reach out to you. If they’re just doing research, you may want to think twice before spending too much time developing a relationship with corporate development. There aren't many people who would say that they are grateful they built a relationship with corporate development, as it usually isn't that helpful when trying to get acquired.

To figure out if they're asking on behalf of somebody, you can get on the phone, or email, and ask, was this something that a specific person or business unit was interested in? If you are a small, busy startup, you don't want to waste your time and so determining if the person asking is truly interested is critical.

Corporate development reaching out can lead to success if the company that might be acquired uses it as an opportunity to create a business relationship with the right executive at the company. You can go and say something like, “Well it'd be great to meet with your head of customer success and talk about how we might work together.” You often find that a commercial partnership is a more valuable way to work together than acquisition.

Before going ahead with the acquisition process, you should check in with yourself and see how you feel about it, figure out what company wants to buy and if they are legitimate, and find out who is asking and if they are truly interested or just doing research.

[**I'm an exec at a company undergoing an acquisition. Should I stay?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1DXxyRPmVLVKM)

If you are an exec at a company undergoing an acquisition, you may be unable to stay, even if you want to. In preparation for this, you should try to look after your mental health and consider your other prospects. 

There is no one-size-fits-all for how to proceed when you are in this position. The right choice is dependent on where you are in your career cycle and what's going on in your personal life. Some people may find that staying at the acquiring company is a feasible option, and it comes with pros, like spending more time with your kids, but for others, there really may not be a place for you in the company afterward.

Firstly, you should realize that the decision is probably not going to be up to you. This is a really hard thing to come to terms with if you have been in a founder or leadership role at a startup company. Until this point, you have probably been a large part of what has made the company successful, so imagining the company without you can be tough.

If you are someone who has thrown themselves into their work and has been unable to see themselves doing anything else for quite some time, surrendering your control during an acquisition is going to be very difficult. In anticipation of this, you should try to prioritize your mental health and do a few ‘selfish’ things. If you've made a lot of sacrifices for your company, now may be the time to focus on yourself a bit more.

Something vital to think about is what you will do if you don't \(or can't\) stay. Try to think about what you want to do and whether it's what the company is doing. You can also think about what you would be doing if you weren’t at the company. If the acquisition might mean that you won’t be working with the company anymore, try and imagine what you will do instead and begin to prepare yourself for this change. For those who see their company as their baby, leaving it can feel devastating, but it can also be a great opportunity to return to something you were once passionate about. \[Ed.: For Lucy, the acquisition of Crowdskout, where she had been the chief strategy officer for five years, gave her the opportunity to return to her roots in advocacy. In 2019, she threw herself into working on the Never Trump movement.\]

If you aren't able to stay at your company after the acquisition, try to look after yourself and your mental health and think about what you could do instead.

**DAY 115** 

[**Are there projects I can undertake while in school to actually prepare me for work in a given field?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1yNxaWyoYalGj)

Working with people, or an organization, who you admire and can learn from can help you develop your perspective and explore how you can apply your point of view to the world.

 \[Ed.: This question came up when I was speaking in an NYU course that Josh Shapiro teaches about the future of work. One of the students, Kimberly Chung, asked about her particular interests, which are around advocacy in the Asian-American community and the intersection of that with urban studies.\]

The old way of thinking about it was, go and get an internship at a place that an employer might recognize. This is still a valid thing to do. It’s a little bit harder during the school year, and maybe even harder now, during COVID. You could also take part in extracurricular activities that are either some big thing on campus or feel particularly attuned to some interest.

\[Ed.: Those clubs on campus always seemed a little weird to me. The investment banking club? Come on, do you really want to be in the investment banking club? Sorry if you're in the investment banking club.\]

 The big thing that's changed in today’s world is that you don't need a seat at an organization's table to learn about what happens in a particular area or even to begin to contribute value. Instead, what you can look for are opportunities that will allow you to develop your own point of view. If someone came up to you and said, "Hey, you're interested in advocacy in the Asian-American community. Well, what should happen in cities with Asian-American populations?"

If you already have a point of view during your school years, well then, that's amazing! The next question is then, "How do you bring your point of view to life?" If you are missing some key skills needed to bring it to life, then go ahead and do a project and get that skill. If you don't yet have a point of view, or if you're not particularly confident in your point of view, then your next question is, "Okay, what projects can I undertake outside of the coursework in order to build a point of view on this domain that I think I care about?"

Something you can do to develop your point of view is find somebody, a person and/or organization that goes about things in a way that you admire and wish to learn from. Once you have found this person or group, try to figure out how you could be useful to them. You could cold reach out to them, even beg somebody you know who might know them, and say, "Hey, I've noticed what you're doing about X. I've been researching it, and I’d like to be helpful. Here's something I can do for you."

Finding something that allows you to learn and gain knowledge can significantly benefit you later. Affiliation with any organization is something you can probably turn into a discussion point on your resume or LinkedIn when trying to get a job. If the thing you have to solve is learning, then find somebody you admire and learn that thing. Easier said than done, but it’s researching first and then generating opportunities for yourself.

The internet presents itself as a good platform for collaboration and connecting with people. You may find a Reddit thread that you like or a random blog or Twitter profile that you think is really interesting. You can then start with what the person reads and likes and go from there.

Although the internet offers a great opportunity to get in touch with these people and have greater access to them, try to avoid falling into the trap where you believe the most visible people are the ones from whom you can learn the most. This isn’t necessarily the case, as these people are more visible simply because they promote themselves more. Often it is the people who have fewer followers who are the most eager to have collaborators.

If you would like to prepare yourself for a particular field during school, try to find people or an organization with knowledge that applies to that field. Gaining knowledge and learning more about something can help you develop your point of view and can be a discussion point on your resume when you’re trying to find a job.

[**How much does due diligence on my investors matter, and how do I do that?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1rmGPzjEEkjxN)  
****

**\[Ed.: People use VC Guide as a tool to do diligence about investors and figure out who to reach and whether to work with them.\]**  


**Due diligence on your investors is very important as it is very hard to drop them if you are unhappy. Your research on your investors can include asking around about them, using tools like VC Guide and asking them questions directly.**  


**Due diligence matters a lot, especially these days. Venture capitals and asset classes are changing very rapidly. There is currently the most founder-friendly market that has existed for a long time. With so many different emerging fund managers and investors, the really big question that founders should ask is, "Who would be an active value-add to my cap table."** 

**How much it matters depends on the stage, if they are a board member, large cheque or minority investor. Something you can do, especially if you have a large network, is to back-channel with other founders and ask them what they think or know about a certain investor. It doesn’t matter whether these conversations happen in person, via text, twitter or DMS so much as you get information from people you trust.**  


**If you don’t have a large network, you’re going to be a bit more active in your research. You can look at certain signals, like what kind of content the investor has produced.  A lot of investors these days are actually becoming their own content creators, and also creating their own distribution channels. Content that investors produce, be it a podcast, blog, etc., serve as indicators of whether the investor will align with your company thesis.**  


**There are also certain questions that you should ask the investor yourself when you're in a pitch meeting. Some of these include, Do you have a built-in audience? How do you drive distribution for your portfolio companies? Are you an expert in something that you could teach us as a course? Can you refer me to other portfolio founders of yours? Can I talk to these founders?**   


**Along with these questions is a question that you should ask yourself: After spending X amount of time with this investor, can I imagine myself building this business without them? In an ideal world, you would spend a significant amount of time with an investor before you decide to work with them, just like you date someone for a long time before you marry them. Unfortunately, COVID has resulted in many pitch meetings happening over zoom, but where possible, try to spend time with the investor.**

**You should only take them if you can't imagine building the company without them. Sometimes this isn’t a priority because you just need money and there's one person who is willing to give it you, so really all you want to know is if he’s an axe murderer or not.** 

**Raising money is challenging and gruelling, so by the time an offer comes in, there's often a sense of relief that it is finally over. When you get to this point, you only want to hear good things and as a result you may be a bit lax when it comes to reference checking, VCs and diligence tools like VC Guide.** 

**Most founder's underdo it, which is dangerous when you consider that an investor is like an employee,  except it's very hard to fire them. When you think about how many references you do on a hire or how much research and diligence you do on a potential employee, how does this change if hiring that person were irreversible?**    


**Founders generally don’t do enough background checks on founders, even though it's really important. You can do this by asking fellow founders for advice, asking the investor questions, and doing research using tools like VC Guide.**

[**How do I set boundaries on how much I work when there's always more to get done?**](https://t.co/cTNzeePqlY?amp=1)  
****

**You can go about your work in two ways, one is to work until you have achieved what you set out to achieve, and the second way is to decide beforehand how much effort you are willing to put into your work. You may also choose to use an important vs urgency graph like in ‘The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.’**  


**This can be a problem faced by many founders, particularly those who work on something that has broader social consequences, as it's so easy to convince yourself that there's more to do.**   


**\[Ed.: I feel a little bit like a pot calling the kettle black trying to answer this question, because I only do okay at this in my own life and I'm very inconsistent about it.\]**  


**People often manage it in one of two ways. There is no one answer, and how you go about it depends on the phase in life that you're in, and what your goal is.**   


**The first way is to work until a certain standard is reached. This is when you decide what you want to do and what progress you want to make, and then you do as much work as necessary to achieve the goal you’ve set. Although effective for some, it can lead to intense burnout because you have less control on a day-to-day basis over exactly how much you do. Often a person starts to burn out and they’re forced to adjust the standard, or do fewer things.**   


**Another method is to set a box. This box is how much effort you are willing to give to work relative to other things in your life, like hobbies or family.**   


**\[Ed.: A good friend of mine, an economist named Jonathan Tepper, once said, "The problem with success isn't that people don't know how to achieve, it's that most people are unwilling to pay the price." And what he meant there was a certain kind of professional success, and you should have an idea of what you're willing to sacrifice to get it.\]**

**Another way to think about it is as a graph, like what is referenced in the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, where the degree of importance is plotted on the one axis with how urgent it is on the other. When you are feeling overwhelmed, you can think about the four quadrants and ask yourself what is important and what is urgent and you can prioritize your tasks in that way.**

**The hardest part is regarding the important, non-urgent tasks which you want to spend time on. This is sometimes some of the most fulfilling work in your day and you can set boundaries so that your day includes this. Sometimes you may need to give something up if you want to spend time doing the important, less urgent thing.**  


**People generally tend to choose one of two ways to approach their work. The first is to only stop working once you have finished what needs to be done, the second is to set an amount of effort you are willing to put into work and stop when you have reached this limit.**  


**DAY 118**

[**How do I take a break without feeling guilty about my career progression?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1RDxlPDvLngxL)

**If you want to take a break from work but are feeling guilty about your career progression, trying to source where this guilt comes from can help you accept or overcome it. Thinking about what you will do during and after your break can help your inner experience.** 

**There are many reasons why you may arrive at a place where you want to take a break from work. \[Ed.: Hady previously had to travel a lot for work, but with the pandemic, she suddenly saw herself being in one place for more than two weeks. As she rested more and began to feel its effects, she realized that rest was actually very important. She felt that because of her fast-paced job, she rarely got the rest she needed\]**

**If you have the opportunity to decide to pause, how you do it depends on many different factors, like how wealthy you are, race, gender, etc. Two very important aspects of the process are how you will market yourself while you aren’t working and how you will manage curiosity when you return.**

**One thing to think about is how you will craft your return. Whatever your reasons are, whether you want to take a break for your mental health, travelling, or something else, if you want to return to work, you should probably think about how you’re going to do that.**   


**Thinking about what your return to work will be like can help a lot. If you're thinking about taking 6 months off, you’re probably going to return to some tough conversations. After all, humans are curious, and so you're probably going to receive a lot of, "Why did you take six months off?" Having a game plan on how you will answer these questions can help you deal with them.**

**You can also come up with a strategy on what identity you will take during your time off. \[Ed.: When I took time off, I knew what my plan was for afterwards, but I changed my LinkedIn title to “doing nothing” because I wanted to stop people from bothering me.\]** 

**If your goal is to still have people contacting you, you may want to change your LinkedIn to something like ‘Currently looking for XYZ.’**  


**The core issue is that of the inner experience. Having a plan of how you will take time off and what you will do when you come back helps calm your inner experience. Managing one's inner life is the most underrated professional skill. Ben Horowitz says that the hardest part of being CEO is managing your own psychology, and this is actually true for everybody, not just CEOs.**   


**If you are feeling a deep sense of guilt around taking a break, you should ask yourself what might be driving that feeling. Is it because, like so many people, you have a tendency toward guilt? If it is, is there an issue you can work on? Is your feeling of guilt actually because of feelings about something else? Try to approach your guilt like a scientist operating on themself. Mental health professionals are awesome when it comes to assisting with this, and if you are in a position where you can access someone like a coach or therapist, they can really benefit you.**  


**\[Ed.: For Hady, her sense of guilt was largely due to her being the child of immigrants. Being only in her only 30s, taking a break from work whilst her parents were still working made her feel guilty. She felt as though she didn't have the right to take a break so early on.\]**  


**You may be thinking to yourself, "Well, I can have a job and lots of people can't; who am I to take a break?" The critical thing to realize here is that just because somebody else has suffered doesn't mean you need to suffer too. Your suffering won't make the world any better. Feeling guilty about your own struggles because others have it worse won’t help them or you.**   


**A lot of professionals assume that they'll be judged to a degree that they will not be. Even if you are judged, this is just a price you pay. It takes courage to identify something and name it as a price. \[For Hadi, the price may be that her parents will be mad.\] But just because something has a price doesn't make it wrong. In many cases, the question isn’t should you or should you not do something, but rather, what is the price of doing it, and how can I minimize this price? Working out if you are willing to pay the price can give you valuable insight into whether you should go forward with something.**

**If it is worth it to you, you'll be willing to pay the price.**  


**If taking a break from your career brings up feelings of guilt, thinking about your plan of action for during and after your break can be of benefit as well as evaluating your feelings of guilt and trying to find their roots.**

**DAY 119**

[**How do I keep track of what I need to do every day without getting bogged down?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1vAGRweNdjrJl)  
****

**You can keep track of what you need to do each day by using software like WorkFlowy or Range. You can then use timeboxing or ‘eating the frog” methods to ensure you complete the important tasks of the day.**  


**Sometimes you know what you need to do on a given day, but at the end of the day, you have the feeling that you didn’t really get to those things or complete them. Once you know what you need to do, having something, a system, that makes it easy to do that thing is what matters.**

**One way to keep track of the tasks you simply must do is to use something like** [**WorkFlowy**](https://workflowy.com)**. In WorkFlowy, you can have a bullet that says today, under which you put the two or three things you need to do. You can display this in a visible spot and refer to it throughout the day.**

**A way to get the things on that list done is to “eat the frog.” This is when you schedule time for the undesirable but extremely important things and get them done first. Actually having a scheduled time on your calendar where you focus on today’s items can help you get into the groove of completing them. Usually, once you have worked through that list you feel a lot better.**   


**Unfortunately, these systems still allow for distraction. \[Ed.: If anyone knows of software that intermittently flashes on your screen when it knows you’re free and says, "Hey, now is the time to do it," please let me know, that would be great\]**  


**Something that can also help your productivity is time boxing. This is used in the popular Pomodoro technique, where you set a single task for a 20 or 30 minute period and don’t focus on anything else. It can be shocking how productive you can be when you force yourself to focus on one thing.**  


**If you want to broadcast your priorities for the day to a team, you can use Range. Range is a team success piece of software where you can do asynchronous check-ins with your teammates about your priorities. Although Range doesn't allow for the flexibility and text editing that Workflowy does, it's still a great way to keep track of your commitments and hold yourself accountable.**  


**If you are struggling to keep track of what you need to do in a given day, using software like WorkFlowy or range can really help. If you are struggling to complete the things on your to-do list, consider trying a method like eating the frog or the Pomodoro technique.**  


**DAY 120**

[**How do I kill projects when everything feels important?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1LyGBdmLlwWxN)

**If you are struggling to figure out which projects you should kill, you can use this** [**10 Step Plan**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Ga8kyj9KeOb1WPA0rVLNqRYjdNJHEEZLkUQs70_V0U/edit)**. How to go through these steps and use this plan is detailed below.**  


**Your starting point for this exercise is making a list of the most important things to you. This is a list of your top priorities. \[Ed.: For Madho, they are his family, his health, and then his work.\] Try not to overthink or dwell on this too long, just take a deep breath and write down whatever comes to mind.**  


**Once you have this list, you can then write down everything you think you're working on. It is ‘think you're working on’ rather than know, as sometimes you think you're working on something and then realize through this process that you actually aren't. Figuring out what you're actually working on is an additional benefit of this exercise as you clear mental inventory and space, leading you to be less likely to stress.**

**After completing your list of what you're working on, you can make a line down the middle of your page and begin to sort your items. On one side of the line goes everything that fits into your top priorities. The rest goes on the other side. What does and doesn't fit with your priorities should be clear-cut, if you think that something is on the margin, it doesn't fit-- get rid of it.**   


**Now that you have two categories, it's time to divide them into two parts again. This time, you're going to separate them according to whether you have started them or not. The same principle applies when you are figuring out what fits with your priorities; if you can't decide if you have started it or not, then you haven't started it.**   


**Now, taking a look at the things you have started, you can determine which of those things involve commitments to other people. This is important because although a certain project may not be one of your priorities, it may be important to someone else. Go through the list of things you've started and ask yourself, “Does this project have meaningful value for other people? Will it hurt them if I don't deliver on it?" You need to figure out what the impact will be on others if you let something hit the floor. If you end up deciding to drop the project, it's best to consider its effect on others beforehand so you're prepared to pay this price. If killing it entirely isn't an option, you can also ask yourself, "How can I help this person take the project forward?” Just because you can't take it forward yourself doesn't mean that there isn't some way you can help.**  


**Now that you've done all of this work, you can get a blank piece of paper and write down everything that doesn't fit your priorities, hasn't been started, and does not involve a meaningful outside commitment. You should keep these things safe for later because they are worthwhile projects for another time, but as of now, they are the things you can kill.**  


**What you end up killing will depend on what your categories look like, and that is different for everyone.**

**\[Ed.: I often kill the things that I thought would be a really great idea for someone to do and doesn't exist yet where I thought, "Might as well be me."** 

**For Madho, the projects he usually kills are those things that he imagined could come to life, but things he didn't have buy-in anywhere else and so naturally fell onto the list of things he hasn't started. \]**  


**Going through these steps doesn’t necessarily lead to you ending projects, it could cause you to look for alternative ways of doing it. If you are applying this model to a company or specific work, it may be an option to outsource the thing you are convinced will provide value.**

**Maybe instead of building those walnut shelves yourself, you should just go to Ikea and buy a shelf and have a task rabbit put it together. The 10 Step Plan becomes a good tool to triage, more than anything else.**   


**What is important to remember is that just because you made this list once doesn't mean you made it forever. Things can shuffle and change, and it can be worthwhile to come back to this exercise and the list once in a while. The more you do this exercise, the more you exercise that ‘muscle’ and make it stronger. You will find that you stop taking things on and say no earlier, saving yourself from pain later on.**  


**If you know you need to kill some of your projects but can't figure out which ones to kill, you can use the** [**10 Step Plan**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Ga8kyj9KeOb1WPA0rVLNqRYjdNJHEEZLkUQs70_V0U/edit) **as an exercise to determine the projects you can afford to lose.**
