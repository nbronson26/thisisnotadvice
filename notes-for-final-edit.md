# / Notes for final edit

* When we have guests: include their info at the end of the "chapter," per the following style: _\[Contributed in part by_ [_Nitin Pachisia_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/npachisia/)_, Founding Partner,_ [_Unshackled Ventures_](https://www.unshackledvc.com/)_\] - Name linked to LinkedIn, or Twitter if more popular on that platform, company linked to company website_
* From Roy: I say "You have to" a lot and those are often words that can just be deleted. Is there an easy way to do a global search and replace for example? Gitbook may be a little too slow for that... I may have to use a different text editor.
