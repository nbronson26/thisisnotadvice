# / Style guide

* When we have guests: include their info at the end of the "chapter," per the following style: _\[Contributed in part by_ [_Nitin Pachisia_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/npachisia/)_, Founding Partner,_ [_Unshackled Ventures_](https://www.unshackledvc.com/)_\] - Name linked to LinkedIn, or Twitter if more popular on that platform, company linked to company website_
* From Roy: I say "You have to" a lot and those are often words that can just be deleted. Is there an easy way to do a global search and replace for example? Gitbook may be a little too slow for that... I may have to use a different text editor.

## Voice

Avoid passive voice. Phrases like

## \#thisisnotadvice live video ties

Always point to Periscope links.

Omit needless words and phrases. For example, you can usually strike:

* "it is important to"
* "you need to"
* "you should"
* "a lot of" \(this is a phrase that sounds more natural when spoken than written\)
* Even the word "that" often adds nothing!
* WOrds like "are" and "is" often provide clues that you can simplify a sentence. Consider "consider what your options are" vs. "consider your options."
