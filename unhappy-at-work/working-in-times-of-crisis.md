# Getting things done / productivity

#### [How should I get more done?](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1RDxlQAZbDDKL) 

Start with one list: your "offense list." This is a list of the things you want to achieve each day. It could be a few short things. It could be one thing.

There's a tool called [WorkFlowy](https://workflowy.com/) \[Ed.: Bloomberg Beta invested in it\]. It's a listkeeping piece of software. Use that, or something else you prefer. It's easier for it to be digital because it carries over to the next day. And then first priority in terms of time in the day, it's called "eat the frog," do the undesirable thing, just get it done. You know, in [_The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_](https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/0743269519), they talk about things that are important, but not urgent, as the highest priority things -- do those. 

The second part is to have a "defense list," e.g., email. These are the things you must do even if they don't advance your main goals. You could even put to-dos in email to keep it all in one place.

Practice [Inbox Zero](https://www.fastcompany.com/40507663/the-7-step-guide-to-achieving-inbox-zero-and-staying-there-in-2018). If you have multiple inboxes like text, WhatsApp, Twitter, Telegram, you should get to Inbox Zero them all. Probably one of them is your primary inbox and try to push everything there if you possibly can. Do email as few times per day as possible, and process it in a batch. Spend the rest of your time, as much of it as possible, playing offense.

The tools you use will change a lot over time. Constantly re-examine your process because there's always a way to keep getting better and better at this, to be doing things that are more important as opposed to just saving time. When it comes to productivity, keep throwing out the baby with the bath water. And when in doubt, focus on typing faster.

Sometimes that's just hard. Be easy on yourself, be compassionate at yourself. Sometimes you have to progress without knowing if you're going in the right direction. Look up, seek support from your friends, and do your best to move in the right direction.



\*\*\*\*[**How do I avoid feeling overwhelmed by the flow of information?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1yNxaBdBmoDKj)

There's a myth that information overload is a modern phenomenon. 

\[Ed.: I teach a business school class at UC Berkeley on media and I start the course with this [quote](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1279403-adagia) from Erasmus from the 16th century: 

â€œIs there anywhere on earth exempt from these swarms of new books? Even if, taken out one at a time, they offered something worth knowing, the very mass of them would be an impediment to learning from satiety if nothing else."\]

Information overload comes from expecting you can read or consume more media than you can. \(Here we'll focus on news, since catching up on email or instant messages, Slack, etc. is a separate subject.\)

**Separate out the informational value from the aspect that's compulsive** -- an addiction. It's fun during the day to check in, go look at Twitter for a minute or Daily Mail. **As long as you're aware you're indulging, it can be OK.** Otherwise, pick your information diet. It can feel like you're making progress when you read a lot of headlines and doomscroll on Twitter, but it might not be serving you in a particularly helpful way. So catch yourself when you're doing that.

**Be precise about which kinds of information you need, when you need them, and why.** Then read the things that give you that knowledge in a systematic \(even if it's a limited\) way. There may be some things that you must know to do your job. \[Ed.: For example, with what we do at Bloomberg Beta, there are certain things we need to know. We need to know which big new investments got announced that day because we might be talking about it with others, or we might talk to somebody involved and want to congratulate them. In this case, I look at any one of several wonderful tech newsletters.\] 

Some items you must know immediately -- for example, a news story that mentions your company might be important to know right away. \(You can use Google's [Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts) to follow that.\) Other things are OK to catch up on at the end of the day. Many things that seem important in the morning blow over by the afternoon.

Other content is more of a "nice to read," enriching your perspective. While this kind of content is hardly ever _necessary_ to doing your job in any given day, the most successful people tend to be curious and consume information to indulge that curiosity. Many people go in "campaign mode" on this kind of enriching content, focusing on one topic deeply, turning it all off for a while, or other methods for mixing it up. It's a myth that there's one "right way" to consume media that should last you forever.

Think about which people you might need to know about. LinkedIn automatically emails you when someone you know is [mentioned in the news](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50021/mentioned-in-the-news-feature?lang=en). \[Ed.: This technology comes from [Newsle](https://newsle.com/), which was our first investment at Bloomberg Beta.\] Before you have a first meeting with someone, try to research them. 

**Choose your tools with care.** [Nuzzel](https://developers.nuzzel.com/) can give you the news your friends shared over the course of the last week, for example -- so it's good for catching up when you've been away. Choose newsletters carefully, and consider whether to use [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) or some other service to save the nice-to-read content for later.

Newsletters can be extremely useful, because their writers often curate news for you. You can also then focus on reading them only once, to batch all your reading. \[Ed. There are people I always read, for example [Jason Hirschhorn](https://redef.com/info/about), the king of media newsletters, and his REDEF was for years my go-to for following things in an intensive way because it was curated.\]

You can also work to retain more of what you consume: [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.co/blog/) lays out a [framework](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/) for information that is useful, valuable and interesting, and finding where those circles overlap. 

**If you miss some news, skip stressing about it.** Somebody may say, "Oh, you didn't hear about that?" And you can say, "Actually, no. I didn't." Have the strength to admit when you haven't read something and ask for more information. Your time is often more important than staying up to date on every last development in your industry.
