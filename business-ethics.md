# Making ethical choices

> I get questions all the time asking for advice about different situations at work. And "this is not advice" is where we answer them because you have to chart your own path…

#### [How can my company do good in the world and succeed in business at the same time? ](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1YqGoRYQEjEKv)

There was a time when people in business thought about [shareholder value](https://medium.com/@bgadbaw/if-they-use-it-it-must-be-useful-or-is-it-2ccb3f7e241e) as the ultimate aim -- and then many companies began to worry about doing less harm. Today, maybe the answer is that the purpose of business is purpose.&#x20;

\[[Amol Sarva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amol\_Sarva), who informed much of this response, acknowledged that in the context of fighting racism, part of accepting what our purpose must be is accepting that we live in a systemically racist place. You are not innocent either. It's overwhelming. That's why we must do something about it.]&#x20;

Imagine someone who works for your company says, "this "doing good" wasn't a part of my job, I don't want to be a racist and I'm opposed to racism too, but I'm just here to write code." Or, "We have to launch our new product feature, should we delay it for this?"

In some way all of business has always been about uniting competing interests, figuring out how do you serve the customer while being profitable enough (to pick a trivial example that business has solved well). The fight that business has right now, is the fight to figure out how to play an affirmatively good role in the world.&#x20;

If your a founder, is "the business of business is business" the reason you started your company? Or did you have some purpose? \[Amol Sarva: We started our company in an industry where no one invited us. No one asked us to be there. They all told us to go away. We took on an impossible problem and we made it possible. And in the years to come, we will make it more possible. Now, if we think that we built this business just to make some money, that isn't actually true. I mean, that's not why I did it. I wanted to try to build something. And I think all of my colleagues who joined us came to build something that could be big and powerful so that it could make the lives of the people that we were in contact with, our customers, the folks that work in all these buildings, the cities that we operate in, we wanted to just make stuff better. That was the idea.]

You have agency over what you choose to care about. Of course there are tradeoffs: we trade off all day, every day. You need to grow, but not at all costs. You need to deliver incredible experiences for customers -- but customers can't ask for arbitrary nonsense. We have to have some boundaries. We manage all these contradictions.

\[Amol: The business of business is purpose. Do not let someone say, "we can't walk and chew gum." Because we can.]&#x20;

Like so many things in life and in business, we tend to think that some aspect of our work is innate, intrinsic, unchangeable -- like whether you can do good and make money at the same time. So many of these things are just tradecraft. We learn how to resolve these contradictions. We learn how to elevate something like fighting racism to the point where it is central to how the company accomplishes its goals.



[**What do I do if I feel my employer has lost sight of our mission?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1mrGmEEMrlZGy)****

When you join a company, you should look at whether your values align with the business' values. And even if there is strong alignment on values from day one, down the road you may have a moment when you think, "We used to be devoted to our mission, but now we're just about dollars and cents." Or "We used to be about succeeding as a business, but now we're about talking about all this other stuff."

Identify what the issues are for you, or things can start to swirl. The issue could be "my boss is mean to me, and I'm worried about whether leaders at this company treat people well." Or "our CEO gave money to a political candidate who I don't agree with, and therefore I feel uncomfortable working for them." Or, "it's important to me that our company be environmentally friendly, and I see us making bad decisions in that arena." Identify and diagnose these mismatches against your own values. Nobody _really_ knows what a company's values are, you only know their behaviors.

Once you've diagnosed the issues, it's an escalation process. Maybe the answer is "somebody just acted inadvertently, and I can talk to the office manager about getting recycled paper." Or maybe it's so profound that you need to quit. And there are a thousand gradations in between, so there's no one right answer.&#x20;

Know yourself, talk to people at your company who you trust, and gradually escalate based on the severity of the issue.&#x20;

There are inappropriate ways to do this: e.g., you blow up every meeting you're in because of values issues that you have. If you want to remain at the company (and maybe you don't), you need to be savvy about how to address the issue – not swallow your tongue. There's almost always a way to raise the issue; and not every way of raising the issue is equally appropriate or effective.

In addition to reflecting on your issue, also calibrate against your company's life stage. Many early employees will join startups because they are motivated by the mission. Then, as the company becomes thousands of employees, it might look a little different. And your capacity to do things may change – for better or worse – based on your goals. \[Ed.: When I was at News Corp, I was responsible for making the organization carbon neutral, which it remained for a few years after I left. At the time, News Corp had the resources to become carbon neutral because it was able to buy millions of dollars in carbon offsets and reduce its carbon footprint. If we had been an early-stage company strapped for cash and you said, "We need to buy carbon credits," the response likely would have been, "Sorry, but we just need to survive."] Your industry, country, and the stage of your company's life all matter with how a company can act on its mission.



****[**Can I talk about my politics at work? If so, how?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1PlJQNPmlbWxE)****

Anyone who says you shouldn't talk about politics at work has likely spent _some_ time talking about politics at work. The question is what is appropriate or inappropriate. What's appropriate is sometimes politics, as it might be profoundly important to the company, or profoundly important to the person. But what is "just politics" to one person, for someone else could be a matter of survival and existence, or justice and the fabric of the economy and society.

You have to know what the norm is inside of your company. And if you choose to play outside of the norm, that's fine, you have to understand that you may pay a price for it, practically speaking. Coinbase effectively [said](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804) "Shut up and dribble, just focus on the mission." And it's a valid stance, but Coinbase also apparently gave money to Black Lives Matter. So stop and think to yourself, "What is the relevance of this to the discussion everyone is having, and am I participating in this as an individual, trying to use the company toward my own personal ends, or because I think it's kind of relevant to the company as a whole?" And a lot of political issues can be relevant to the company as a whole.

Not everything you say at the company is about the company. You may have personal friends at the company, and it's okay to talk to your personal friends about things in your personal life – like religion and politics and other sensitive subjects – but you have to understand that it's very easy to cross a line into doing that in a company space. Privately emailing somebody or DM-ing somebody who you know shares a view with you about something where you share a view, that's totally fine. You can also ask someone if it's OK to speak with them about something before you do.



[**I've voted, donated, signed petitions. Do I need to do more than that?**](https://twitter.com/roybahat/status/1313993763144962048)****

The more civically active you are, the more likely it is that you feel distraction from focusing on your job. But being civically active also helps make you a whole person. You may learn things through your civic  activities that help you at work, but like anything that's only true within limits. If you're phone-banking all day, when you _should_ be programming, then clearly you're not doing your job. Think about timing and dosage.&#x20;

Start by asking yourself "Why?" And if your reason "why" is that you want to feel like you've done your part as a responsible citizen, that's a valid reason, and the only person who can define that is you. Then think about what's appropriate for you given where you are in your life. A parent with young kids is going to have different priorities than a person with roommates who's trying to make their life work.&#x20;

&#x20;\[Ed.: There have been times in my life where my priority was to have dinner with my wife versus doing  volunteering. In fact, I still prefer to do that.] Recognizing what works for you – aligned with your priorities – is important.

The other thing to recognize is that different ways of contributing feel different and have different value to you. For example, phone-banking might feel wonderful: you're talking to real voters, it's like doing customer in some ways. But it might also feel like, "Does it matter that it's _me_?" Especially if you're text-banking, where it feels like a bot could be sending these messages.

\[Ed.: I go to a food bank with my family once a year with our school, and technically it could be anyone that handles the volunteer duties that day. But it's important to me that it's me because of how I feel.]

There are also ways of contributing that may feel more unique to who you are, whether it's a community you're tied to or (if you're in tech) a software-development project through an organization like [Ragtag](https://ragtag.org/projects/category/custom+software) or [Tech for Campaigns](https://www.techforcampaigns.org).

You can participate civically in ways that feel unique to you and where you're moving the needle, but it takes time and effort, the same way it took you time and effort in your day job to know how to have an impact. You're not going to show up on day one and be like, I'm a VC. I'm going to know about investing. You have to know the context to be able to provide value.

There are moments in the world that call many of us to see the problems and wish to do something about them and weave them into our lives. Most people I know are feeling something like that. And then the question is the skill of, how? Engage in a way that feels like it's worth your time and effort and you feel fulfilled by it – and that is a process of timing and dosage and learning.

\[Ed.: For emerging leaders in the tech industry, Bloomberg Beta has a community that we run with Stanford called [First Principles](https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/first-principles-forum/about/), where we learn together how to give philanthropically. Secondly, there is a leadership group called [The Council on Tech in Society](https://www.linkedin.com/company/council-on-technology-society/), where the primary focus is educating ourselves civically. Civic engagement requires a progression of learning, and groups like these can be incredibly useful for figuring out how you can help move the needle.]
