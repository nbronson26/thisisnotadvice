[**How do I need to think differently working as an investor vs. starting a company?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1dRKZZQMwjoKB)\*\*\*\*

Founders often think, "How would an investor think about this?" And investors often have to get in the head of management. 

As an investor, you think about what can go wrong. For example, if the economy slows and the housing market turns down, that might be bad for some company or industry; or what if my tech stock misses earnings and it gets a downgraded multiple... and the list goes on. You naturally have a negative mindset, or at least you always want to be thinking about the possible negative things that could happen. 

As a founder, you can feel bogged down by all of the processes of starting your company â€“ getting lawyers, getting registered, getting insurance and so on. But when you actually tell people, "Hey, I started a company," people around you are usually excited. It makes you understand the power of positive thinking, and you need that positivity when you're starting a company. As an investor, you don't think like that.

The thing that positivity allows you to do is pick a few things that really matter and be proud of making them great. But not every founder has this mentality and that's okay. Founders need to understand that each company has a unique investor base that's optimally suited for that company. Think of two companies on the opposite end of the spectrum: 1\) a company like Tesla, which is almost messianic in believing in this mythical figure as their leader, and 2\) a cigarette company that's selling death on a stick, where as an investor says, "Just pay me the dividends and buy back the stock. I know you're doing a terrible thing, but I'm taking this money." Most companies fall somewhere in between and it's up to a CEO or an executive to know, "Why do people own my stock? Is it for dividends? For buybacks? To feel good?" If you have a mismatch, you will have a lot of problems.

Often companies face the biggest issues when they transition from one phase of a life cycle to a new one. Newly public companies often are really bad at this transition. \[Ed.: Conor had a bad experience with Zillow, which he's owned eight or nine years ago. He thought, "Okay, I'm bullish on housing. Here's a site that lets you look at prices." The stock seemed pretty cheap because people were skeptical of IPOs at that point. There was one quarter where they did an acquisition of an apartment rental company and the company they bought represented a decent share of Zillow's revenue for advertising. On their earnings report, they said, "We missed revenue because we bought this company and they're not paying us money anymore because we own it." Then an investor simply said, "They missed revenue," and the stock went down 20%.\] As a private company, you think, "We're building the future. No big deal." As a public company the reality is, "You missed earnings."

Talk to investors at different stages to understand the perspectives from where you may be someday.  Seeking different perspectives can go such a long way to understanding how to run your professional life.



#### [How can I get a job in venture capital?](https://www.pscp.tv/w/ccPx_zFsWktwWXhYSnhvam58MWdxeHZhd25QZUJKQgKWP6VmP8UcsP6cuEXwLSWDxMUBRL3CSMbz0r9XqJdY)

**Do you really know what venture capital is all about?** Many people have misconceptions. For example, if you want to be a successful venture capital investor, it isn't obvious that the best way to start is by trying to be a \(junior\) venture capital investors. The very best VCs, tend to be people who had some significant professional life experience -- starting a company, being a respected Wall Street analyst, etc.

Many aspiring VC's believe that being an investor is mostly about giving advice to founders. "I love giving entrepreneurs advice!" It's different when they're your friends. **Founders often merely tolerate receiving the advice of VCs. They placate their investors to get what they really want, which is money.** \(One reason for this is the vast majority of VC advice is inane.\)

Early-stage venture capital is different from investing in public markets, where you contemplate big-picture trends, analyze numbers, and make seasoned judgments based on data. A better comparison is to an [A&R person in the music business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artists_and_repertoire). Your job is to discover new acts, exercise taste on whether or not you want to work with them. Your job is to cultivate them and help them be successful and, ultimately, serve them. Given that, like what does an A&R person _do_? There are some fun parts. You go to parties and talk to people. You're thinking about music you love. However, much of it is grunt work. Who should we invite to this event? How do we organize a CRM to make sure we've been in touch with people? 

**If you do want a job in VC, here are some thoughts on how to get one:**

Focus less on making a case about yourself \("I'm really thoughtful about technology!"\) and more on demonstrating you are a startup junkie. For example, a candidate who says "I love this one company in your portfolio but I'm curious how you thought about this other thing" is favored over a candidate simply saying " I am great at \[X\]." Venture capital is an occupation where the junkie bar is high.  

If you lack a network of people who know VCs who can vouch for you \(and almost nobody has this network\), then you have to figure out how to reduce the risk to the person hiring you. You can reduce the risk by showing them you've "done the work" or volunteering to do a project. A candidate who has done a little bit of research and been thoughtful in their outreach and done more than a cut and paste stands out. In a sense, it's similar to apply for a job in VC or be a founder asking to get funding. 

The venture capital industry can be opaque. There are ways you can learn about it -- many VC's have an active presence on Twitter. Bloomberg Beta's [manual](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual) is online. There are also many investors who do regularly write content online -- if you write some, that's another way for you to stand out. 



[**To be successful as a VC, is it more about deciding what to invest in, or hustling to get an investment, or negotiating well? Or something else?**](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1mnGelXLEaQKX?t=18m40s)\*\*\*\*

To know whether  you have been successful as a VC, you need a consistent track record of backing. Sometimes these are multi-decade relationships with the very best founders in the world. Bill Gurley has [said](https://www.geekwire.com/2013/dozen-learned-bill-gurley-investing-business/) VCs are a business of grand slams, i.e., if your idea is not something that can generate $100 million in revenue, you may not want to take venture capital. It's actually even harder than that: It is a game where your success is measured by the tape-measure distance of your single longest home run. For a VC, sometimes even a grand slam isn't enough.

The skills depend on the stage of company in which you invest. If you're a late-stage investor, picking and pricing correctly are probably the most important things. Your universe is knowable in terms of which companies are out there. If you're the earliest-stage investor like Bloomberg Beta, sourcing \(i.e., seeing the companies in the first place\) might be most important. Your biggest misses can be "dark deal flow,", i.e., when a company goes straight to an investor because they had a preexisting relationship, so you never heard about them. \[Ed.: There are thousands of those deals all the time and missing them makes me paranoid. At Bloomberg Beta we believe if we serve founders well, everything else will follow. Founders ask other founders which investors to work with. So if you serve founders well, you're more likely to win. How do you see deals in the first place? Oftentimes from founders in whom you have invested.\]

[Skill in negotiating, "getting cute" with contractual terms, is almost never the most important skill](https://marker.medium.com/dear-first-time-angel-investor-c6af249a694b). We win, in venture-backed startups, by having huge successes, not by wringing an extra 10% out of the ones that struggle \(which is usually when the kinds of contractual terms that you negotiate in an investment end up mattering\).
