[**How do I need to think differently working as an investor vs. starting a company?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1dRKZZQMwjoKB)\*\*\*\*

Founders often think, "How would an investor think about this?" And investors often have to get in the head of management. 

As an investor, you think about what can go wrong. For example, if the economy slows and the housing market turns down, that might be bad for some company or industry; or what if my tech stock misses earnings and it gets a downgraded multiple... and the list goes on. You naturally have a negative mindset, or at least you always want to be thinking about the possible negative things that could happen. 

As a founder, you can feel bogged down by all of the processes of starting your company â€“ getting lawyers, getting registered, getting insurance and so on. But when you actually tell people, "Hey, I started a company," people around you are usually excited. It makes you understand the power of positive thinking, and you need that positivity when you're starting a company. As an investor, you don't think like that.

The thing that positivity allows you to do is pick a few things that really matter and be proud of making them great. But not every founder has this mentality and that's okay. Founders need to understand that each company has a unique investor base that's optimally suited for that company. Think of two companies on the opposite end of the spectrum: 1\) a company like Tesla, which is almost messianic in believing in this mythical figure as their leader, and 2\) a cigarette company that's selling death on a stick, where as an investor says, "Just pay me the dividends and buy back the stock. I know you're doing a terrible thing, but I'm taking this money." Most companies fall somewhere in between and it's up to a CEO or an executive to know, "Why do people own my stock? Is it for dividends? For buybacks? To feel good?" If you have a mismatch, you will have a lot of problems.

Often companies face the biggest issues when they transition from one phase of a life cycle to a new one. Newly public companies often are really bad at this transition. \[Ed.: Conor had a bad experience with Zillow, which he's owned eight or nine years ago. He thought, "Okay, I'm bullish on housing. Here's a site that lets you look at prices." The stock seemed pretty cheap because people were skeptical of IPOs at that point. There was one quarter where they did an acquisition of an apartment rental company and the company they bought represented a decent share of Zillow's revenue for advertising. On their earnings report, they said, "We missed revenue because we bought this company and they're not paying us money anymore because we own it." Then an investor simply said, "They missed revenue," and the stock went down 20%.\] As a private company, you think, "We're building the future. No big deal." As a public company the reality is, "You missed earnings."

Talk to investors at different stages to understand the perspectives from where you may be someday.  Seeking different perspectives can go such a long way to understanding how to run your professional life.
