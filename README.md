# #thisisnotadvice about work

\[Ed.: This is not advice because I need to know a person well to have a view on what's best for them.]

[**So what should I do with the advice I get?**](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1PlKQNVnraNGE?t=9m52s)

All advice is autobiographical, it's usually a person trying to get you to either live out and justify their choices or worse, they want you to be a vicarious experiment for them and see how it turns out.&#x20;

Never ask for advice from somebody who will give you a specific answer or prescription, especially if they have power over you, because you then may become bound to act on it in some way. This is the person who will later say, "I told you to do that and you didn't listen."

Often people want a magic wand, a silver bullet – an easy answer. Advice usually doesn't work. What you need is a hypothesis, a guess to consider.&#x20;

There are only rare cases where you actually want an answer to, "What would you do in this exact situation?" Circumstances differ from one situation to another, the right course of action does, too.

Seek out a range of options, and understand your choices. Then decide for yourself.
