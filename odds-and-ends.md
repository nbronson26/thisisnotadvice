# Odds and ends

#### Why do you refer to "organizations" so often as opposed to companies?

The reason we use the word organizations is because companies, governments, nonprofit organizations, are more similar than they are different. Mike Bloomberg says, on the difference between business and government: [In business it's dog eat dog. And in government, it's the reverse.](https://www.mikebloomberg.com/news/mike-bloomberg-speaks-harvard-business-school-class-day/) \[Ed.: I'm trying to  make sure that I am aware of as many contexts as possible. Having worked myself in nonprofit, government, academia, big corporations, a small startup, and an investment firm... they're more similar than they are different, although each have their own culture.\]

\[Ed.: I count myself as one of those VC's on Twitter. A good friend of mine, [a neuroscientist](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/3%20-%20Criteria%20for%20investing.md), once said, "I really like what you say on Twitter, except when you talk about founders and companies. Why do you do that? It's so annoying." I do it because I'm proud of the companies we've backed. I want to share their success with others and share with others the fact that we work with that company, which I often do with the [\#proudinvestor](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23proudinvestor%20%40roybahat&src=typed_query&f=live) tag.\]

With startups -- and VC's on Twitter -- the things that are amazing and the things that are horrible are similar to each other. They're more similar than the things that are amazing and the things that are mediocre. You could be an amazing VC producing lots of useful content, drawing founders to work with you, creating controversy -- or you could be a VC who really sucks. Those two personas could look identical to each other on Twitter because one of them might be annoying to certain people.

People should be able to think for themselves, and some of the most amazing people are silent in public. There are great investors who you'll never see anywhere in social media, and there are also mediocre investors who just don't have anything to say. 

VC Twitter is so annoying because you've got lots of "near misses to greatness" that turn out to be awful -- pablum central.
