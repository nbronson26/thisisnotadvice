****[**Should I be an angel investor?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1mnxellMlQqJX)****

\[Ed.: The below comes** **from [Sergio Marrero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergiomarrero/), General Partner at [Rebel One](https://rbl1.com).]

It's important to note that the average person is not allowed (by law in the US) to be an angel investor. The rules about being an accredited investor are pretty restrictive in terms of the percentage of Americans who qualify. (For unaccredited options, you can check out crowdfunding platforms.)

Think about what you want to get out of being an angel investor. If you are practicing the startup trade, i.e., you're a founder or you want to be a VC, then putting your own money into making choices is the best way to learn. And it takes less money than people think.

If you take the leap to be an investor, don't make an investment until you see lots of investments, lots of options. If you want to do it, an advantage is knowing friends who may want money for their companies or already have a foot in this world. But assume you're going to lose all your money. (Roy has written a post for first-time investors [here](https://marker.medium.com/dear-first-time-angel-investor-c6af249a694b)).&#x20;

Know that VCs love co-investing with angels. Angels are often dollar-for-dollar the best investors around, particularly the ones who have started companies before. And VCs meet companies through them. \[Ed.: One of the founders that Bloomberg Beta backs, Andrew Quarter, sold this company to Twitter and they met him through an angel investor who was involved].&#x20;

One of the first things to do is join some angel networks who you can start to ask questions. \[Ed.: At Rebel One, we just launched an angel network of people that want to invest with us. And it's free to sign up and we share deals. Seeing the deals over and over, you start to understand what other investors are looking for.] You need to have a community who you can turn to with questions because it's an apprenticeship type of profession.

When you join an angel group, know that there are lots of different types and levels of these groups. \[Ed.: I joined the Harvard Business School Angels and assumed it would be very rigorous and methodical. I went to a couple of meetings and they were the opposite of what I expected].

With angel groups, the best scenario is when people are in a position where they can make decisions individually. They sometimes join groups, but they rarely think and decide as a group. Part of the  advantage of individual angel investors is that they think for themselves. \[Ed.: Pete Skomoroch is a great example of this because he shares his opinion and it's clear that it's only his opinion.] You want individual views so you can get a diversity of perspectives.&#x20;

If you are in the privileged position to consider becoming an angel investor, think about what you want to get out of it, join angel groups to build community and ask questions, and make sure you see a lot of investments before you take the leap to invest.
