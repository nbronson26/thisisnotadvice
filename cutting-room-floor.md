[**Is it good to be extreme?**](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1PlKQNVnraNGE?t=1m2s)\*\*\*\*

It can have a big impact to share a point of view that you know most people are going to be rocked by. Being blunt and extreme about things that are true, or may be true, can be really clarifying for people around you. You often receive an exhale from others who are thinking, "Yeah, why didn't I say that?" 

Being extreme or blunt takes practice, but some of the best  leaders do it. There are also many people who never get the confidence to be extreme and are still incredible leaders – they just need to make space for themselves to think and know how they're understood. 

You may think, "That's nice, but I could never be extreme in a large organization." It's really not that different in a large organization versus small. It just takes practice. Founders are always at least somewhat confident to speak their mind, but when you hear a mid-level corporate executive speak up, it feels like, "Whoa, she's a truth seeker." 

Work can be boring so being extreme – and adding clarity and honesty – can make exciting things happen.
