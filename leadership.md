# Leading

### Making decisions

[**What do I do if my teammates disagree with how to handle a difficult situation?**](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1PlKQNVnraNGE?t=6m54s)

When something bad happens, you both want to share the news and decide on a course of action.\
\
Some leaders start with communicating individually with everyone involved -- it feels safer, often, and then you can gather individual opinions. That has a cost: things will get lost in translation through multiple conversations. You may think this is respectful or nice, but it may actually be a disaster because everybody will hear their own version of things and will get more frustrated.&#x20;

Instead, get everyone in one room – or the same virtual "room" – to create a single forum to address the issue. Explain how you're thinking about the issue. If the course of action is contentious, you can go around the room and have folks say, "I disagree, but I commit." (Meaning they commit to the company's course of action.)

You need to have them commit to the solution because if somebody doesn't, that's when a mess happens. And people can ask you for the same thing, saying, "CEO, I know that you don't agree. Are you committing to this?"

A team member might ask, "We disagree on this, are you okay going along or do we need to hash out another solution?" It's extremely helpful for clarity to ask in this way, and sometimes the CEO just needs to make the final call and the team needs to be clear on that decision.&#x20;

Sometimes your team just wants you to make a decision, and you need to get clear on that by asking, "What are the decisions that you're asking me to make?"

### Boards

#### [How should I prepare for my first board meeting?](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1MnGndOEmPOxO)

The first question is whether you even need to be there. Often your first interaction with a board, whether you work for a big company or a startup, is being called in as a guest. \[Ed.: I'm a skeptic on the value of boards ("[boreds](https://also.roybahat.com/boreds-7c4c33bda84a)") in very early stage companies. Let's assume for a moment that your board is constructive and helping you, and more than a tax on your time.]

In a first board meeting, neither you nor your board members knows exactly what to expect. The issue is, everybody seems to think that you should default to a formula. "Use these eight slides. First talk about this, then that." The issue with a formula is that it may only apply to a certain stage in a company's life or a certain business model. (Or you might be in a nonprofit or some other setting!)

For example, if you have a startup board meetings before product-market fit, it's a different exercise than for a company managing quarterly sales targets. A general rule is to **try to understand what the other parties, the board members, expect**. Then give them what they expect, but not necessarily in the exact way they expect. As a leader, you don't want to be a follower; you want to set the tone.&#x20;

**Here's what you might expect:** Some board members might say, "I want to get a general sense of how the company is doing. Then I want to see if there are any important issues for discussion." In most board meetings you'll also have some required housekeeping to do -- approving minutes of the last meeting, or grants of options to employees in a venture-backed startup.&#x20;

Usually you'll have an attorney for the company present. That person will make sure you're doing everything by the book and will be there to listen. Most good law firms provide that service at no charge. (They consider it an opportunity to be part of the strategic direction of the company.)

Board meetings tend to run slightly more formally than normal meetings. Sometimes they use[ Robert's Rules of Order](https://www.robertsrules.com), with motions, and passing. You vote on actions, which is rare in a normal meeting.&#x20;

**You generally want to send an agenda and any background materials in advance**, that alert them as to the status of the company, and tell them what you want to talk about. Surprising people in the board room barely ever works.

That could be a Google Doc. It could be a simple PowerPoint. Apportion the amount of time you spend preparing to how far along the company has progressed -- e.g., if you're in a day zero company, spending two days preparing for your every other month board meeting, detailing all the experiments you did, that's a real tax on your time. Don't do that. Your time is your company's most precious asset.

Then, once you're in the room, **be prepared to "release the agenda" and go with where the directors want to go.** It's a dance, getting done what you want to get done while giving others what they want. Oftentimes, founders and executives want to grind their point, get through to the end of the agenda. That can be a mistake.

**A successful board meeting leaves board members feeling they have a sense of what's going on, and like they had a chance to contribute.** Ask them their opinions. Many boards host a social event after a meeting -- they share lunch or dinner. That can be a way to build relationships, and expose some of the rest of the team to the board in a lower-pressure setting.

If you're a member of the team who's called in to present to the board, ask the CEO, "What will this meeting be like? How formal should I be?"

**It never goes the way you planned.** Great companies can have awful boards, and terrible companies can have boards that function well. \[Ed.: I have heard from many people involved with the greatest companies ever, that their boards were extremely dysfunctional.] Deal with it the best you can. Having a great board meeting is not as important as product market fit, or as important as your customers.&#x20;

Everything will fall into line if the company is working. If the company's not working, an A+ board performance won't save you.&#x20;

In the era of a pandemic, you're likely hosting meetings over video. To manage that room, be explicit. "Oh, I saw you nodding, \[so and so]. Did you have something you wanted to add?"

If you have a friend who you really trust, who's willing to let you, consider asking them if you can be an observer in _their_ board meeting. Show up once, to just get a feel for it. Then at least you'l do away with the mystery. One of the worst things about a board meeting can be the anxiety of not knowing how to prepare for it. Once you're in there it's time to perform, "Let's just do this thing."

[**How should I talk to my board or team when I have bad news?**](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1PlKQNVnraNGE?t=4m39s)****

Some people will never share a piece of bad news with their board because they don't even recognize that it's bad news – they won't admit it to themselves. You need to be comfortable admitting it to yourself first.

You're always going to have some bad news to share. Whenever something bad happens, your instinct should be to share it. Take a beat, calm down, quiet your emotions (though you can listen to them!) and the intensity of the situation, and think of a plan.

When you need to share bad news, try to make sure you're not tied up in the issue emotionally -- try to have a plan of how you're going to find a solution. Your board is meant to be there to support you and brainstorm solutions, but as CEO you should be one step ahead and give them a starting point.

You'll build a lot more trust with your board if you're upfront about an issue. And the odds are that your board has seen a similar situation thousands of times before, and it's not as bad as you think. So often, the cover-up is worse than the crime.

The contents of a board meeting should never be a surprise to anyone in the room. One way to guarantee this is to informally get together with board members on a regular basis, over lunch or video call, to share the good and bad of what's going on.&#x20;

[**What do I do if a reporter writes a great story about my competitor?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1DXGyAOzbBNGM)

The default: do nothing. Some people may assume it's a cataclysmic event when a reporter writing a story  giving your competitor, and not you, attention. The reality: eventually nobody remembers. Customers matter more. Talent matters more.&#x20;

\[Ed.: I've experienced different flavors of reporters writing about startup competition, for example when I was working with the MySpace team at NewsCorp, and there were endless stories about Facebook. (At this time, Facebook also had to deal with endless stories about MySpace.) I also saw this when the company that I co-founded had raised a small round of funding, and a competitor started by two industry veterans received coverage that _they_ had raised $5 million.]

When should you have a reaction? When you think that the story reveals some important fact, or changes the strategy of what you ought to be doing, then consider how to respond. When you say to yourself, "Oh my gosh, we learned our competitor released a product that's better in every way than our product, and the next version of it," then you may have to rethink what your product does. Ask yourself, "What new information did I get, and how do I redo our strategy?"

A common reason you to respond: you anticipate some effect this story will have on a stakeholder you care about. Do you need to manage thoughts and expectations from your employees, existing customers, prospective customers, or funders, and make it clear how you stand out from competition?

If you've raised money, how do you manage the communications with your investors before they come to you with questions? Investors often send the annoying "I saw suchandsuch-competitor in Product Hunt. Are you aware?" _Yes_ I'm aware. I do this every day. I'm paying attention to what everybody else is doing. So, investors, don't send those. Founders, if you get them it's fine to say, "Thank you for sharing that." Sometimes your investor just want to be reassured, because they're worried and they just want something to say, in which case give them a one-line thing, a phrase. They're not actually asking because they want the answer, they themselves are just afraid.

The single most important constituency is your customers. Ask if and why this article may spook them, and then ask: A) have your customers really even noticed? and B) if they have, and if they're asking you about it, then how can you diagnose the reason they're asking? Be open and upfront; handle the underlying issue. Don't overreact to the press, react to the substance.

With employees it can be very different. Some employees are lured by splashy competitors. Maybe the competitor's founder is somebody famous who gets a lot of press attention. It's hard to compete for talent against the "hot" company. Sometimes they're hot because they deserve it, in which case you should figure out why they deserve it, and how to beat them. Sometimes they're just hot because they have certain people involved, and they will fizzle out eventually -- the hard part is just to be patient.

If you're in a market where you're competing for talent with a hot competitor then try to think about how you can make that an advantage? How can you get certain kinds of talent that prefer to be in the environment you can create, and take the facts on the ground and make them as much of an advantage as possible.

Sometimes your competitor gets a glowing profile and that day sucks, and you just need to weather the storm and move on to the next day. You don't always have to do something. Read [Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46677.Alexander\_and\_the\_Terrible\_Horrible\_No\_Good\_Very\_Bad\_Day), and just go to sleep that night and hope tomorrow is better.

### Culture

[**As a CEO, how do I respond when employees become active on social or political issues?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1rmGPYzdpMVJN)****

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong got quite a reaction when he shared a blog post entitled [Coinbase is a mission focused company](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804), where he laid out the company's commitment to being "apolitical" and steering clear of societal issues outside of the business's scope. (He then shared a [follow-up piece](https://blog.coinbase.com/a-follow-up-to-coinbase-as-a-mission-focused-company-6e7545e9aea2) about the ensuing departure of 60 employees who took the exit package offered to those who were not aligned with the company's position.)&#x20;

In the U.S., this is quickly becoming one of the critical questions for employee culture because  social and political issues have become a part of daily conversation. People are going to bring their views to work, whether they express them or not. And the lines get really hard to draw between what's appropriate at work and what isn't.&#x20;

At Coinbase, they said, "We'll stay focused on our mission."&#x20;

Then Paul Graham [tweeted](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1310583298666696705), “I predict most successful companies will follow Coinbase’s lead. If only because those who don’t are less likely to succeed.” (Basecamp also followed suit later.)

And  others followed on with varying opinions, including Techmeme founder Gabe Rivera who [tweeted](https://twitter.com/gaberivera/status/1310714255763628033) "their very decision to write and publish it is... taking on activism outside Coinbase's focus!"&#x20;

\[Ed.: I've personally felt this issue because I've been active on a bunch of social issues through work, e.g., guaranteed income, getting the tech industry to be more philanthropically astute and active, visiting emerging startup ecosystems – all to make the future of work "work." In my personal life I try to keep out of work stuff, but it's public information that my wife and I have raised money for political candidates and that I'm working on getting out the vote, and I'm currently en route to Wisconsin to work on getting out the vote.

When I was a CEO, we had an employee who transitioned gender, and this was before this happened frequently at most companies or at least people weren't as aware about it. Our intention was to be super supportive of this person to model the kind of company we wanted to be. And I spent an entire day in one-on-one or small group meetings with everybody in the whole company, group by group.

It was amazing, and I learned a ton, and I felt proud of how supportive we were. I hope that that person felt the same way. And I recognize I couldn't have done it if it were a bigger company or if it was happening more often. And so the lines get complicated.]

As an employee, you have to be conscious of what stage a company is at and what it can do for you, and as a CEO you have to do the same with what you can do for your company and team.&#x20;

\[Ed.: I'm very supportive of employees organizing, but at a past company I had somebody who had decided to focus full time on their social activism work, while they were being paid for another role. If someone isn't doing their job, at some point you have to say, "Listen, we're not here fund you to do this other stuff, unless that's explicitly your role."]

As CEO, you can't default in practice to either extreme. You can't default to ["shut up and dribble"](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/19/587097707/laura-ingraham-told-lebron-james-to-shutup-and-dribble-he-went-to-the-hoop) because you will struggle to draw the lines. Previously Coinbase [donated to Black Lives Matter](https://twitter.com/brian\_armstrong/status/1268623330132635648?s=20), which is great, but they can't have it both ways and flip in the completely opposite direction and say, "We only work on things where everybody feels comfortable with it" or conversely, "We always get active in any social and political issue that an employee is active on." Paul Graham later said that [opposing Trump might be aligned with Coinbase's mission (and that of other startups)](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1310962808117493761).

The technology industry has a particular problem with this because of what I call the "tech paradigm," which I've [spoken about with Alex Kantrowitz on The Big Tech Podcast](https://onezero.medium.com/a-vc-explains-why-vcs-are-so-pissed-off-right-now-88aee103df16). One aspect of the tech paradigm is that tech loves absolutes, loves zeros and ones.

When you have more nuanced, complex issues with companies that are very big, absolutes are hard. And many founders have not ever thought deeply about political and social issues because of the previous life experiences they've had. So they approach issues thinking they're simple, but they're actually very hard and nuanced.&#x20;

What you need to do is come up with a principle by which you decide, and iterate on that principle. As a CEO, you need to recognize that if you're dealing with these issues for the first time, you are probably totally out of your depth. This is an amazing time to turn to advisors and trusted investors.&#x20;

Unlike most CEO skills, navigating social and political issues is not a skill that CEOs often had a chance to practice before they take the role. It's not like managing a team. By the time you've been a CEO, you've probably managed lots of stuff, but you haven't necessarily dealt with these principle issues around social beliefs because they're company-wide issues.

If you're in this situation as CEO, avoid a pitfall. It's really tempting to try to declare by fiat what's going to happen. You can't do this with social issues because your employees are going to talk about whatever they're going to talk about. You can ban them from company communications platforms, and they'll find other places to talk. You have to work with the energy that your employees bring. You can create specific venues for the purpose of employee conversations about "political" issues.

There's also a question about who gets to decide what counts as a "political" issue -- for many people, especially folks who are not straight white men, there's a wider range of issues that are directly relevant to their ability to work. Deciding unilaterally as the leaders, [as Basecamp did](https://world.hey.com/dhh/basecamp-s-new-etiquette-regarding-societal-politics-at-work-b44bef69), can often backfire.

How a company addresses social and political issues is so central for a big company. And at a tiny company where you're just figuring it out, it's sort of like saying, "How do I communicate about the product with employees?" which is to do it in every appropriate form and channel. It shows up in everything. It's a timing and dosage thing. Companies have failed because the CEO got too focused on their cause related work, and the company never got product market fit.&#x20;

Responding to social and political issues is a timing and dosage issue like so many things, but[ it's the wrong answer to tell people, "Check your beliefs at the door](https://twitter.com/roybahat/status/1387167377524105218)." Whatever you do, show empathy to the employees who feel the most strongly about these issues -- who may come from a different background than yours. Try to understand their perspective more deeply.

\[Ed.: I can't check my beliefs at the door, and one of the things I love about Bloomberg and Bloomberg Beta is that we have an environment where it's very encouraged to bring your giving to work. We support philanthropy. Mike Bloomberg is out there as a role model, he served in public office, he gives generously. So when I'm doing something like [#walkthevote](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23walkthevote\&src=hashtag\_click), I can do it and feel like I'm still doing my day job, but it's appropriate and acceptable because it's part of my identity. I work at a company that believes in democracy and participation in the process and it comes from the top.]

[**How transparent should I be about employee salaries?**](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1mnGelXLEaQKX?t=27m40s)****

You can only answer this question if you know the broader culture of the company -- because salary transparency usually fits into that ethos. [Netflix pays people top of market](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/08/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-on-high-salaries-the-best-are-easily-10x-better-than-average.html) because they have a whole system of values that surrounds that approach. [Buffer is transparent about salaries](https://buffer.com/salary/staff-product-designer/average/) because they have a companywide, consistent commitment to extreme transparency. You can't answer this question in isolation.&#x20;

All other things being equal, is it better to be transparent? Yes. But sometimes transparency is not worth the price of that intense pain and discomfort for people on the team. Transparency is hard. It takes work, and can be painful.

\[Ed.: We went through a debate before publishing[ the average value of our initial investments](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/1%20-%20Manual.md#the-numbers). The work required to get everyone comfortable took time. It's paid off -- we strive to be the most transparent investors -- but it's hard. This one choice only made sense in the context of an entire strategy around transparency, which we use to build trust.]

****[**What language can I use to make sure everyone on my team feels included?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1RDGlrmLBwoxL)

Avoid metaphors that exclude people. We often use sports metaphors: "Let's leave it all on the floor,"  "we're going to knock it out of the park," or "we're going to hit a home run." \[Kieran: I've played sports my whole life. This language is effective for me. Imagine my surprise when somebody put up their hand in a team meeting and said, "I'm not from here. And I don't know what 'knock it out of the park' means."]

Avoid using the inclusive-seeming "he or she," and choose them instead. Many of us grew up being taught to write using the "neutral" pronoun, "he." So when talking about something a random person would do, you would say, "He might consider working for Bloomberg." To be inclusive, we learned to say "he or she." Even when you go the extra effort to say "he or she," you're still leaving some people out: non-binary people. A lot of people with the best of intentions to bond and create an inclusive environment, say "he or she" when you are actually better off saying "they." A little known linguistic nerd fact is that [the singular "they" has been in the English language for a thousand years](https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/25/677177).

Metaphors are also great for diving deeper on a point you want to make, but can also be problematic _–_ e.g., [military metaphors often rationalize mistreating people](https://shift.newco.co/2016/11/15/business-is-not-war-lets-stop-talking-like-it-is/). Choose universal human experiences instead: food and cooking. We all eat. We all love it. Play to topics in the universal human experience: driving, walking, nature.

[**How should I think about diversity when building a company?**](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1PlKQNVnraNGE?t=24m11s)

Goal setting for diversity is the easiest part, but often people don't take this step. Anyone can set goals. The hard part is execution.&#x20;

The organizations that do the best at anything, whether it's diversity and inclusion efforts, or workplace safety, tie the issue to their core purpose for being.&#x20;

You _will_ thrive and grow if you have people around the table who do not think like you. It might feel harder because people may not think the same way, and not be as easily – or quickly – aligned, but the ideas will be way more interesting.

_\[Ed.: The above comes from_ [_David Rogier_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drogier)_, founder and CEO of_ [_MasterClass_](https://www.masterclass.com)_. They set goals for diversity externally and internally – both on who teaches and who serves as employees. Diversity is a key part of their mission and what they care about because we want anybody to be able to learn from the best in the world. At MasterClass they have people on the team who have won Emmy's, and we have people who have PhDs, and we have people who haven't finished school.]_
